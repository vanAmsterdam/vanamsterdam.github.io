I am a senior research scientist at Babylon Health, working the intersection of machine learning and causal inference for health care applications.
Before, I was a PhD student at the radiology department of University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands.
I have a degree in physics (BSc.), medicine (M.D.), epidemiology (MSc.) and a Phd in machine learning for health care.
