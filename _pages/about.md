I am an assistant professor at the University Medical Center Utrecht, working at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference for health care applications.
Before, I was a PhD student at the radiology department of University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands,
co-advised by Rajesh Ranganath from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.
For 1.5 years I worked as a senior research scientist at Babylon Health
I have a degree in physics (BSc.), medicine (M.D.), epidemiology (MSc.) and a PhD in machine learning for health care.

I'm based in the Netherlands
