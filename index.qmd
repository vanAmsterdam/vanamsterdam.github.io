**Learning from Historical data to make better decisions in the future**\
I work on the intersection of machine learning (for flexible data analysis) and causal inference (to learn to make better decisions).

I am an assistant professor at the University Medical Center Utrecht, working on methods and applications of machine learning and causal inference for health care.
I have degrees in Physics (BSc), Medicine (MD), epidemiology (MSc) and a PhD on machine learning for healthcare, advised by [Rajesh Ranganath](https://cims.nyu.edu/~rajeshr/) from NYU and Joost Verhoeff, Tim Leiner and Pim de Jong from the UMC Utrecht.

<!--Master students with a background in statistics or machine learning who want to work with me are welcome to contact me.-->
<!--Students enrolled at Utrecht University or UMC Utrecht can find open master projects on [konjoin](https://uu.konjoin.nl/profile/wouter-van-amsterdam)-->

**Babylon Health** | Senior Research Scientist | 2021 - 2023

## Prospective students / collaborators

There are 3 open PhD positions at our data science methods department, see [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maartenvansmeden_hiring-we-offer-3-fully-funded-phd-positions-activity-7321419607016157187-JZ7K/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAATRCVMBLpmDHrCNBUHtp1wJvcz1SLL_8q0)
One of these positions will be co-supervised by me: (preventing) *prediction paradox*: prediction models that when deployed affect the outcome they are tyring to predict through downstream medical decisions. Applicatans with a background in causal inference, machine learning and / or prediction research are welcome to reach out. The position is with Maarten van Smeden, Ewout Steyerberg, Oisin Ryan and myself.

I have several open projects in the field of machine learning and causal inference. Students (MSc / PhD) with a background in statistics, data science or machine learning and good coding skills are welcome to contact me.
