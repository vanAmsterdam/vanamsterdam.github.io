:::{#hero-heading}

I am an assistant professor at the University Medical Center Utrecht, working on methods and applications of machine learning and causal inference for health care.
I like application driven methods research, using assumptions that are likely to occur in the real world.

Master students with a strong background in statistics or machine learning, math and programming, who want to work with me are welcome to contact me.

Before, I was a PhD student at the radiology department of University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands,
co-advised by Rajesh Ranganath from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University.
For 1.5 years I worked as a senior research scientist at Babylon Health
I have degrees in physics (BSc.), medicine (M.D.), epidemiology (MSc.) and a PhD in machine learning for health care.

I'm based around Utrecht, the Netherlands
