  abstract = {Statistical methods for survival analysis play a central role in the assessment of treatment effects in randomized clinical trials in cardiovascular disease, cancer, and many other fields. The most common approach to analysis involves fitting a Cox regression model including a treatment indicator, and basing inference on the large sample properties of the regression coefficient estimator. Despite the fact that treatment assignment is randomized, the hazard ratio is not a quantity which admits a causal interpretation in the case of unmodelled heterogeneity. This problem arises because the risk sets beyond the first event time are comprised of the subset of individuals who have not previously failed. The balance in the distribution of potential confounders between treatment arms is lost by this implicit conditioning, whether or not censoring is present. Thus while the Cox model may be used as a basis for valid tests of the null hypotheses of no treatment effect if robust variance estimates are used, modeling frameworks more compatible with causal reasoning may be preferrable in general for estimation.},

  abstract = {Background: Assessment of malnutrition, performance status and systemic inflammation are routine aspects of clinical assessment in patients with advanced cancer. There is increasing evidence that body composition measurements from routine staging CT also have prognostic value. To date the relative prognostic value of Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), modified Glasgow Prognostic score (mGPS) and CT derived body composition analysis in patients with advanced lung cancer has not been examined. The aim of the present study was to examine this relationship. Methods: Clinicopathological characteristics including MUST, ECOG-PS, mGPS and body composition data were collected pre-radiotherapy from a prospectively maintained database of patients with advanced lung cancer (n = 643). Using the MUST score, patients were classified into low (MUST = 0, n = 189), medium (MUST = 1, n = 341) and high (MUST ≥ 2, n = 113) malnutrition risk and their relationship to systemic inflammatory response (SIR) and body composition with clinical outcomes were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Primary outcome of the study was overall survival. Results: Compared with the patients at low nutrition risk (MUST = 0), patients at moderate to high risk (MUST 1–≥2) had poorer ECOG-PS {$>$} 1 (p {$<$} 0.01), elevated modified frailty index (mFI) (p {$<$} 0.001), elevated mGPS (p {$<$} 0.001), lower skeletal muscle index (SMI, p {$<$} 0.01) but not lower skeletal muscle density (SMD, p = 0.115). MUST was an important prognostic marker of 12 months overall survival (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, higher MUST (HR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.03–1.31, p {$<$} 0.05), ECOG-PS {$>$} 1 (HR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.10–1.39, p {$<$} 0.001), elevated mGPS (HR 1.20, 95\% CI 1.09–1.33, p {$<$} 0.001) were independently associated with overall survival. Conclusion: A large proportion of patients (71\%) with advanced lung cancer were at moderate to high nutrition risk. Higher malnutrition risk and elevated inflammatory status were independently associated with poor overall survival. MUST, ECOG-PS and mGPS all had independent prognostic value and may form an important prognostic framework in treatment decision making and resource utilization © 2020 The Authors},

The same results have been obtained after elimination of the adrenal-renal portal circulation (ARPC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of concomitant kidney denervation and elimination of ARPC on hypertension in SHR. 2. Experiments were performed on 6-week-old male SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. In the first group of animals (group I), the ARPC was eliminated by removing the left adrenal gland and the right kidney. In the second group of rats (group II), the right kidney and the right adrenal gland were removed and the left kidney was denervated. In the third group of rats (group III), the right adrenal gland and the left kidney were removed and the right kidney was denervated. In the fourth group of rats (group IV), the right adrenal gland and the right kidney were removed. Group IV served as the control group. Denervations were repeated every 3 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was measured indirectly. 3. Elimination of ARPC (group I) and kidney denervation (group II) delayed and attenuated hypertension to the same degree (163 +/- 5 and 157 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively). Application of the these two methods concomitantly (group III) prevented the development of hypertension (130 +/- 6 mmHg). 4. We conclude that both intact efferent sympathetic renal nerves and adrenal hormones reaching the kidney through the ARPC may be mandatory factors for the development of arterial hypertension in SHR.}

  abstract = {Background Nivolumab has promising efficacy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Various predictive factors for nivolumab response in those with NSCLC have been reported, including performance status (PS). The objective of this retrospective study was to determine the predictive factors for nivolumab response in those with NSCLC with good PS and those with poor PS. Methods We retrospectively collected pretreatment clinical data of 296 consecutive patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab. We investigated the relationship between progression-free survival (PFS) and patient characteristics and analyzed predictive factors associated with good PS (PS 0-1) or poor PS (PS 2-4). Results The median age of patients was 70 years; 206 patients were male, and 224 were classified as having good PS (PS 0-1). The median PFS was 3.0 months, 3.7 months, and 1.2 months for all patients, patients with good PS, and patients with poor PS respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that never smoking (hazard ratio [HR], 1.77; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.75), high C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.93), liver metastasis (HR, 1.95; 95\% CI, 1.24-3.07), pleural effusion (HR, 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.00), and steroid use (HR, 2.85; 95\% CI, 1.65-4.94) were associated with significantly shorter PFS in patients with good PS. A high advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) was significantly associated with longer PFS in patients with poor PS (HR, 0.24; 95\% CI, 0.08-0.79). Conclusions In patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab, the factors found to be predictive of shorter PFS in patients with good PS were never smoking, high CRP, liver metastasis, pleural effusion, and steroid administration, whereas high ALI was predictive of longer PFS in patients with poor PS.},

  abstract = {Despite tremendous resources being invested in prevention and treatment, breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths in women globally. The available treatment modalities are very costly and produces severe side effects. Drug repurposing that relate to new uses for old drugs has emerged as a novel approach for drug development. Repositioning of old, clinically approved, off patent non-cancer drugs with known targets, into newer indication is like using old weapons for new battle. The advances in genomics, proteomics and information computational biology has facilitated the process of drug repurposing. Repositioning approach not only fastens the process of drug development but also offers more effective, cheaper, safer drugs with lesser/known side effects. During the last decade, drugs such as alkylating agents, anthracyclins, antimetabolite, CDK4/6 inhibitor, aromatase inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor and mitotic inhibitors has been repositioned for breast cancer treatment. The repositioned drugs have been successfully used for the treatment of most aggressive triple negative breast cancer. The literature review suggest that serendipity plays a major role in the drug development. This article describes the comprehensive overview of the current scenario of drug repurposing for the breast cancer treatment. The strategies as well as several examples of repurposed drugs are provided. The challenges associated with drug repurposing are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) patients have poorer survival and local control with mediastinal node (N2) tumor involvement at  resection. Earlier assessment of nodal burden could inform clinical decision-making  prior to surgery. This study evaluated the association between clinical outcomes and  lymph node volume before and after neoadjuvant therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT  imaging of patients with operable LA-NSCLC treated with chemoradiation and surgical  resection was assessed. Clinically involved lymph node stations were identified by  FDG-PET or mediastinoscopy. Locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM),  progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the  Kaplan Meier method, concordance index and Cox regression. RESULTS: 73 patients with  Stage IIIA-IIIB NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgical resection  were identified. The median RT dose was 54 Gy and all patients received concurrent  chemotherapy. Involved lymph node volume was significantly associated with LRR and  OS but not DM on univariate analysis. Additionally, lymph node volume greater than  10.6 cm3 after the completion of preoperative chemoradiation was associated with  increased LRR (p{$<$}0.001) and decreased OS (p = 0.04). There was no association  between nodal volumes and nodal clearance. CONCLUSION: For patients with LA-NSCLC,  large volume nodal disease post-chemoradiation is associated with increased risk of  locoregional recurrence and decreased survival. Nodal volume can thus be used to  further stratify patients within the heterogeneous Stage IIIA-IIIB population and  potentially guide clinical decision-making.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective  study, 98 patients (83 men and 15 women; mean age, 61.9 ± 8.0 years) with  unresectable NSCLCs (stage IIIA, 45; stage IIIB, 53) underwent definitive CCRT at  our institution from January 2006 to December 2011. Patients were followed up for 3  years or until death. The CT texture parameters of primary tumors were extracted  from contrast-enhanced CT images taken before CCRT using an in-house software  program. Each texture parameter was dichotomized based on their optimal cutoff  values obtained from receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Three-year  OS was compared between the dichotomized subgroups using Kaplan-Meier analysis and  the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine  significant prognostic factors. RESULTS: The 3-year cumulative survival rate was  0.51. The mean 3-year OS was 24.0 months (95\% confidence interval, 21.5-26.6  months). There were no significant differences in 3-year OS according to tumor stage  or histologic subtypes. However, entropy (P = 0.030), skewness (P = 0.021), and mean  attenuation (P = 0.030) were shown to be significantly associated with 3-year OS.  Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that higher entropy (adjusted hazard  ratio [HR],2.31; P = 0.040), higher skewness (adjusted HR,1.92; P = 0.046), and  higher mean attenuation (adjusted HR,1.93; P = 0.028) were independent predictors of  decreased 3-year OS. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography texture features have the  potential to be used as prognostic biomarkers in unresectable NSCLC patients  undergoing definitive CCRT.},

  abstract = {The presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase activity was studied histochemically in the sensory ganglia of the rat. Supraspinally, the trigeminal ganglion possessed only a few cells positively stained for NADPH-diaphorase, while a large number of positive neurons was found in the nodose ganglion. In the dorsal root ganglia, the distribution of positive cells showed a peculiar pattern in relation to spinal levels. Very minor populations (less than 2\% of the total ganglionic cells) exhibited positive reaction in ganglia at levels ranging from the first cervical (C1) to fourth thoracic (T4) and from the second lumber (L2) through the entire sacral levels. In the middle to lower thoracic levels (from T5 to L1), however, abundant diaphorase-positive cells were observed. From these positive neurons it was possible to trace intensely stained nerve fibers. In the lower thoracic level, for example, dense positive fibers were seen in the ramus communicans. Retrograde tracing studies revealed that diaphorase-containing neurons in the lower thoracic level project at least partly to the gastric wall and the celiac ganglion. These results indicate that the diaphorase-positive ganglionic neurons in the thoracicolumbar levels may carry autonomic visceral afferent information. Double staining with NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry and peptide immunohistochemistry revealed that NADPH-diaphorase colocalizes with calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P in many of these visceral afferent neurons.},

  abstract = {We investigate the problem of machine learning-based (ML) predictive inference on individual treatment effects (ITEs). Previous work has focused primarily on developing ML-based meta-learners that can provide point estimates of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE); these are model-agnostic approaches for combining intermediate nuisance estimates to produce estimates of CATE. In this paper, we develop conformal meta-learners, a general framework for issuing predictive intervals for ITEs by applying the standard conformal prediction (CP) procedure on top of CATE meta-learners. We focus on a broad class of meta-learners based on two-stage pseudo-outcome regression and develop a stochastic ordering framework to study their validity. We show that inference with conformal meta-learners is marginally valid if their (pseudo outcome) conformity scores stochastically dominate oracle conformity scores evaluated on the unobserved ITEs. Additionally, we prove that commonly used CATE meta-learners, such as the doubly-robust learner, satisfy a model- and distribution-free stochastic (or convex) dominance condition, making their conformal inferences valid for practically-relevant levels of target coverage. Whereas existing procedures conduct inference on nuisance parameters (i.e., potential outcomes) via weighted CP, conformal meta-learners enable direct inference on the target parameter (ITE). Numerical experiments show that conformal meta-learners provide valid intervals with competitive efficiency while retaining the favorable point estimation properties of CATE meta-learners.},

Machine learning technologies can enable accurate prognostication of patient outcomes under different treatment options by modelling complex interactions between risk factors in a data-driven fashion. Here, we use an automated and interpretable machine learning algorithm to develop a breast cancer prognostication and treatment benefit prediction model—Adjutorium—using data from large-scale cohorts of nearly one million women captured in the national cancer registries of the United Kingdom and the United States. We trained and internally validated the Adjutorium model on 395,862 patients from the UK National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), and then externally validated the model among 571,635 patients from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme. Adjutorium exhibited significantly improved accuracy compared to the major prognostic tool in current clinical use (PREDICT v2.1) in both internal and external validation. Importantly, our model substantially improved accuracy in specific subgroups known to be under-served by existing models. Adjutorium is currently implemented as a web-based decision support tool (https://vanderschaar-lab.com/adjutorium/) to aid decisions on adjuvant therapy in women with early breast cancer, and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians worldwide.},

  abstract = {Summary There is ongoing controversy about the role of health-care workers in transmission of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We did a search of the literature from January, 1980, to March, 2006, to determine the likelihood of MRSA colonisation and infection in health-care workers and to assess their role in MRSA transmission. In 127 investigations, the average MRSA carriage rate among 33\hphantom{,}318 screened health-care workers was 4·6\%; 5·1\% had clinical infections. Risk factors included chronic skin diseases, poor hygiene practices, and having worked in countries with endemic MRSA. Both transiently and persistently colonised health-care workers were responsible for several MRSA clusters. Transmission from personnel to patients was likely in 63 (93\%) of 68 studies that undertook genotyping. MRSA eradication was achieved in 449 (88\%) of 510 health-care workers. Subclinical infections and colonisation of extranasal sites were associated with persistent carriage. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of screening and eradication policies for MRSA control and give recommendations for the management of colonised health-care workers in different settings.},

  abstract = {Synthetic data generation is a promising solution to address privacy issues with the distribution of sensitive health data. Recently, diffusion models have set new standards for generative models for different data modalities. Also very recently, structured state space models emerged as a powerful modeling paradigm to capture long-term dependencies in time series. We put forward SSSD-ECG, as the combination of these two technologies, for the generation of synthetic 12-lead electrocardiograms conditioned on more than 70 ECG statements. Due to a lack of reliable baselines, we also propose conditional variants of two state-of-the-art unconditional generative models. We thoroughly evaluate the quality of the generated samples, by evaluating pretrained classifiers on the generated data and by evaluating the performance of a classifier trained only on synthetic data, where SSSD-ECG clearly outperforms its GAN-based competitors. We demonstrate the soundness of our approach through further experiments, including conditional class interpolation and a clinical Turing test demonstrating the high quality of the SSSD-ECG samples across a wide range of conditions.},

Texture analysis represents tumor heterogeneity and may serve as a predictor of response in mUC. OBJECTIVE: To assess the predictive ability of computed tomography (CT) texture analysis for progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with mUC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two postplatinum patients with mUC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors from 2013 to 2018, including those with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 who had contrast-enhanced baseline or first follow-up CT within 3mo after starting treatment, were included. PFS was calculated based on serial follow-up CT scans. Eleven patients with follow-up of {$<$}12mo without progression were excluded. Texture features of measurable lesions on baseline and first follow-up CT were extracted using commercially available software (TexRAD; Feedback Plc, Cambridge, UK) using different spatial scaling factors (0, 2-6). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify patients with PFS {$<$}12mo, and performance was assessed using receiver operator characteristic curves. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 31 included patients, 18 had PFS {$<$}12mo. Twenty-five baseline CT and 29 first follow-up CT scans met the inclusion criteria. In patients with PFS {$<$}12mo, entropy and mean were higher on first follow-up CT (p=0.02 and p=0.005, respectively). A predictive model including mean and entropy on first follow-up CT yielded 95\% sensitivity, 80\% specificity, 90\% positive predictive value, 89\% negative predictive value, and 90\% accuracy (area under the curve=0.963) to identify patients with PFS {$<$}12mo. Limitations include retrospective nature and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: CT texture analysis can help predict early progression with high accuracy soon after starting PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Studies investigating the correlation of texture analysis with survival endpoints may help validate texture analysis as a biomarker of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors' treatment response. PATIENT SUMMARY: Computed tomography texture analysis can help predict durability of response in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer early during treatment with programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review of  patients with Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer treated with chemoradiation at  Brigham and Women's Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 2000 to 2006 was  performed. Tumor and nodal volume measurements, as computed by Eclipse (Varian, Palo  Alto, CA), were used as independent variables, along with existing clinical factors,  in univariate and multivariate analyses for association with outcomes. RESULTS: For  patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy, both nodal volume (hazard ratio  [HR], 1.09; p {$<$} 0.01) and tumor volume (HR, 1.03; p {$<$} 0.01) were associated with  overall survival on multivariate analysis. Both nodal volume (HR, 1.10; p {$<$} 0.01)  and tumor volume (HR, 1.04; p {$<$} 0.01) were also associated with local control but  not distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to traditional surgical staging  variables, disease burden, measured by primary tumor and nodal metastases volume,  provides information that may be helpful in determining prognosis and identifying  groups of patients for which more aggressive local therapy is warranted.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel framework for human-AI collaboration in prediction and decision tasks. Our approach leverages human judgment to distinguish inputs which are algorithmically indistinguishable, or "look the same" to any feasible predictive algorithm. We argue that this framing clarifies the problem of human-AI collaboration in prediction and decision tasks, as experts often form judgments by drawing on information which is not encoded in an algorithm's training data. Algorithmic indistinguishability yields a natural test for assessing whether experts incorporate this kind of "side information", and further provides a simple but principled method for selectively incorporating human feedback into algorithmic predictions. We show that this method provably improves the performance of any feasible algorithmic predictor and precisely quantify this improvement. We demonstrate the utility of our framework in a case study of emergency room triage decisions, where we find that although algorithmic risk scores are highly competitive with physicians, there is strong evidence that physician judgments provide signal which could not be replicated by any predictive algorithm. This insight yields a range of natural decision rules which leverage the complementary strengths of human experts and predictive algorithms.},

  abstract = {The role, indications and modalities of elective resection for sigmoid diverticulitis remain the cause of fierce debate. During the past two decades clinicians have increasingly recognized that: (1) young patients ({$<$}50) are no more at risk to develop more aggressive course of the disease; and (2) patients who present initially with a first uncomplicated attack are no more at risk for developing subsequent complicated diverticulitis requiring emergency surgery. Hence, the previously well-recognized indications (based upon age of the patients or the number of attacks) are no longer valid. Yet, the number of sigmoid resections performed for diverticulitis in industrialized countries is increasing, which seems to indicate that in many cases, uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis progressively evolves towards a chronic symptomatic condition, which significantly impacts upon the patients’ quality of life. The aims of this review are twofold: (1) to identify which disease presentation still represents good indications for elective laparoscopic sigmoid resection; and (2) to summarize the technical aspects of surgery for a benign condition, such as diverticular disease.},

  abstract = {Endovascular renal denervation techniques have been clinically adopted for the treatment of resistant arterial hypertension with great success. Despite the favourable early results achieved with this technology, a clear understanding of the pathophysiology underlying this novel treatment is lacking. In addition, non-responsiveness to renal denervation remains a nidus for treatment failure in distinct patients. In search of meaningful surrogate parameters relating to treatment responsiveness, the current article reviews the existing knowledge on renal nerve anatomy, changes occurring after denervation and procedural parameters collected during denervation. From preclinical experience, the most reliable morphological parameter reflecting successful renal denervation is the presence of axonal degeneration. Most procedural and clinical parameters need extended investigation before adopting them as potential surrogate parameters for successful renal denervation. As a consequence, there is an imperative need for dedicated research revealing the pathophysiology of renal denervation procedures. In this regard, close co-operation of engineers, researchers and clinicians is warranted to turn renal denervation into a milestone treatment of arterial hypertension.}

  abstract = {One pervasive task in the empirical sciences is to determine the effect of interventions from observational data. It is well-known that assumptions are necessary to perform causal inferences, which are commonly articulated through causal diagrams [13]. Despite the power of this approach, there are settings where the knowledge necessary to specify a causal diagram over all observed variables may not be available, particularly in complex, high-dimensional domains. In this paper, we introduce a new graphical modeling tool called cluster DAGs (for short, C-DAGs) that allows for the partial specification of relationships among variables based on limited prior knowledge, alleviating the stringent requirement of specifying a full causal diagram. A C-DAG specifies relationships between clusters of variables, while the relationships between the variables within a cluster are left unspecified, and can be seen as a graphical representation of an equivalence class of causal diagrams that share the relationships among the clusters. We develop the foundations and machinery for valid causal inferences over C-DAGs. In particular, we first prove the soundness and completeness of the d-separation rules extended to C-DAGs. Secondly, we prove the validity of Pearl’s do-calculus inference rules over C-DAGs. Lastly, we show that a standard identification algorithm is sound and complete to systematically compute causal effects from observational data given a C-DAG.},

  abstract = {Background Diverticular disease is a common problem in Western countries. Rationale for elective surgery is to prevent recurrent complicated diverticulitis and to reduce emergency procedures. Recurrent diverticulitis occurs in about 10\% after resection. The pathogenesis for recurrence is not completely understood. We studied the incidence and risk factors for recurrence and the overall morbidity and mortality of surgical therapy for diverticular disease. Methods Medical records of 183 consecutive patients with pathology-proven diverticulitis were eligible for evaluation. Mean duration of follow-up was 7.2~years. Number of preoperative episodes, emergency or elective surgeries, type of operation, level of anastomosis, postoperative complications, persistent postoperative pain, complications associated with colostomy reversal, and recurrent diverticulitis were noted. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative probability of recurrence. Cox regression was used to identify possible risk factors for recurrence. Results The incidence of recurrence was 8.7\%, with an estimated risk of recurrence over a 15-year period of 16\%. Risk factors associated with recurrence were (younger) age (p~{$<~$}0.02) and the persistence of postoperative pain (p~{$<~$}0.005). Persistent abdominal pain after surgery was present in 22\%. Eighty percent of patients who needed emergency surgery for acute diverticulitis had no manifestation of diverticular disease prior to surgery. In addition, recurrent diverticulitis was not associated with a higher percentage of emergency procedures. Conclusion Estimated risk of recurrence is high and abdominal complaints after surgical therapy for diverticulitis are frequent. Younger age and persistence of postoperative symptoms predict recurrent diverticulitis after resection. The clinical implication of these findings needs further investigation. The results of this study support the careful selection of patients for surgery for diverticulitis.},

  abstract = {Locally Rotation Invariant (LRI) image analysis was shown to be fundamental in many applications and in particular in medical imaging where local structures of tissues occur at arbitrary rotations. LRI constituted the cornerstone of several breakthroughs in texture analysis, including Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Maximum Response 8 (MR8) and steerable filterbanks. Whereas globally rotation invariant Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were recently proposed, LRI was very little investigated in the context of deep learning. We use trainable 3D steerable filters in CNNs in order to obtain LRI with directional sensitivity, i.e. non-isotropic filters. Pooling across orientation channels after the first convolution layer releases the constraint on finite rotation groups as assumed in several recent works. Steerable filters are used to achieve a fine and efficient sampling of 3D rotations. We only convolve the input volume with a set of Spherical Harmonics (SHs) modulated by trainable radial supports and directly steer the responses, resulting in a drastic reduction of trainable parameters and of convolution operations, as well as avoiding approximations due to interpolation of rotated kernels. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to standard CNNs on 3D texture datasets including synthetic volumes with rotated patterns and pulmonary nodule classification in CT. The results show the importance of LRI in CNNs and the need for a fine rotation sampling.},

  abstract = {Counterfactual fairness requires that a person would have been classified in the same way by an AI or other algorithmic system if they had a different protected class, such as a different race or gender. This is an intuitive standard, as reflected in the U.S. legal system, but its use is limited because counterfactuals cannot be directly observed in real-world data. On the other hand, group fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity or equalized odds) are less intuitive but more readily observed. In this paper, we use \$\textbackslash textit\{causal context\}\$ to bridge the gaps between counterfactual fairness, robust prediction, and group fairness. First, we motivate counterfactual fairness by showing that there is not necessarily a fundamental trade-off between fairness and accuracy because, under plausible conditions, the counterfactually fair predictor is in fact accuracy-optimal in an unbiased target distribution. Second, we develop a correspondence between the causal graph of the data-generating process and which, if any, group fairness metrics are equivalent to counterfactual fairness. Third, we show that in three common fairness contexts\$\textbackslash unicode\{x2013\}\$measurement error, selection on label, and selection on predictors\$\textbackslash unicode\{x2013\}\$counterfactual fairness is equivalent to demographic parity, equalized odds, and calibration, respectively. Counterfactual fairness can sometimes be tested by measuring relatively simple group fairness metrics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have disease progression despite definitive chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy plus concurrent radiation therapy). This phase 3 study compared the anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibody durvalumab as consolidation therapy with placebo in patients with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive durvalumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. The study drug was administered 1 to 42 days after the patients had received chemoradiotherapy. The coprimary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by means of blinded independent central review) and overall survival (unplanned for the interim analysis). Secondary end points included 12-month and 18-month progression-free survival rates, the objective response rate, the duration of response, the time to death or distant metastasis, and safety. RESULTS: Of 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received consolidation therapy (473 received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). The median progression-free survival from randomization was 16.8 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95\% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P{$<$}0.001); the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 55.9\% versus 35.3\%, and the 18-month progression-free survival rate was 44.2\% versus 27.0\%. The response rate was higher with durvalumab than with placebo (28.4\% vs. 16.0\%; P{$<$}0.001), and the median duration of response was longer (72.8\% vs. 46.8\% of the patients had an ongoing response at 18 months). The median time to death or distant metastasis was longer with durvalumab than with placebo (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months; P{$<$}0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 29.9\% of the patients who received durvalumab and 26.1\% of those who received placebo; the most common adverse event of grade 3 or 4 was pneumonia (4.4\% and 3.8\%, respectively). A total of 15.4\% of patients in the durvalumab group and 9.8\% of those in the placebo group discontinued the study drug because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Progression-free survival was significantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo. The secondary end points also favored durvalumab, and safety was similar between the groups.

Although many patients respond, only a subset has complete response. As late-stage patients often have multiple tumors in difficult access sites, non-invasive techniques are necessary for the development of predictive/prognostic biomarkers. PET/CT scans from 52 patients with stage III/IV melanoma were assessed and CT image parameters were evaluated as prognostic biomarkers. Analysis indicated patients with high standard deviation or high mean of positive pixels (MPP) had worse progression-free survival (P = 0.00047 and P = 0.0014, respectively) and worse overall survival (P = 0.0223 and P = 0.0465, respectively). Whole-exome sequencing showed high MPP was associated with BRAF mutation status (P = 0.0389). RNA-sequencing indicated patients with immune “cold” signatures had worse survival, which was associated with CT biomarker, MPP4 (P = 0.0284). Multiplex immunofluorescence confirmed a correlation between CD8 expression and image biomarkers (P = 0.0028). Implications: CT parameters have the potential to be cost-effective biomarkers of survival in melanoma, and reflect the tumor immune-microenvironment.

  abstract = {Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the major threats to public health around the world. Besides the intense use and misuse of antimicrobial agents as the major force behind the increase in antimicrobial resistance, the exponential increase of international travel may also substantially contribute to the emergence and spread of AMR. However, knowledge on the extent to which international travel contributes to this is still limited. The Carriage Of Multiresistant Bacteria After Travel (COMBAT) study aims to 1. determine the acquisition rate of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae during foreign travel 2. ascertain the duration of carriage of these micro-organisms 3. determine the transmission rate within households 4. identify risk factors for acquisition, persistence of carriage and transmission of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae. Methods/design The COMBAT-study is a large-scale multicenter longitudinal cohort study among travellers (n\,=\,2001) and their non-travelling household members (n\,=\,215). Faecal samples are collected before and immediately after travel and 1~month after return from all participants. Follow-up faecal samples are collected 3, 6 and 12~months after return from travellers (and their non-travelling household members) who acquired multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae. Questionnaires are collected from all participants at each time-point. Faecal samples are screened phenotypically for the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Positive post-travel isolates from travellers with negative pre-travel samples are genotypically analysed for ESBL and carbapenemase genes with microarray and gene sequencing. Discussion The design and scale of the COMBAT-study will enable us to provide much needed detailed insights into the risks and dynamics of introduction and spread of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae by healthy travellers and the potential need and measures to monitor or manage these risks. Trial registration The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under accession number NCT01676974.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The previous individual patient data meta-analyses of chemotherapy in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed that adding sequential or concomitant chemotherapy to radiotherapy improved survival. The NSCLC Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials directly comparing concomitant versus sequential radiochemotherapy. METHODS: Systematic searches for trials were undertaken, followed by central collection, checking, and reanalysis of updated individual patient data. Results from trials were combined using the stratified log-rank test to calculate pooled hazard ratios (HRs). The primary outcome was overall survival; secondary outcomes were progression-free survival, cumulative incidences of locoregional and distant progression, and acute toxicity. RESULTS: Of seven eligible trials, data from six trials were received (1,205 patients, 92\% of all randomly assigned patients). Median follow-up was 6 years. There was a significant benefit of concomitant radiochemotherapy on overall survival (HR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.95; P = .004), with an absolute benefit of 5.7\% (from 18.1\% to 23.8\%) at 3 years and 4.5\% at 5 years. For progression-free survival, the HR was 0.90 (95\% CI, 0.79 to 1.01; P = .07). Concomitant treatment decreased locoregional progression (HR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.62 to 0.95; P = .01); its effect was not different from that of sequential treatment on distant progression (HR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 0.86 to 1.25; P = .69). Concomitant radiochemotherapy increased acute esophageal toxicity (grade 3-4) from 4\% to 18\% with a relative risk of 4.9 (95\% CI, 3.1 to 7.8; P {$<$} .001). There was no significant difference regarding acute pulmonary toxicity. CONCLUSION: Concomitant radiochemotherapy, as compared with sequential radiochemotherapy, improved survival of patients with locally advanced NSCLC, primarily because of a better locoregional control, but at the cost of manageable increased acute esophageal toxicity.},

  abstract = {Assessing the calibration of methods for estimating the probability of the occurrence of a binary outcome is an important aspect of validating the performance of risk‐prediction algorithms. Calibration commonly refers to the agreement between predicted and observed probabilities of the outcome. Graphical methods are an attractive approach to assess calibration, in which observed and predicted probabilities are compared using loess‐based smoothing functions. We describe the Integrated Calibration Index (ICI) that is motivated by Harrell's Emax index, which is the maximum absolute difference between a smooth calibration curve and the diagonal line of perfect calibration. The ICI can be interpreted as weighted difference between observed and predicted probabilities, in which observations are weighted by the empirical density function of the predicted probabilities. As such, the ICI is a measure of calibration that explicitly incorporates the distribution of predicted probabilities. We also discuss two related measures of calibration, E50 and E90, which represent the median and 90th percentile of the absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities. We illustrate the utility of the ICI, E50, and E90 by using them to compare the calibration of logistic regression with that of random forests and boosted regression trees for predicting mortality in patients hospitalized with a heart attack. The use of these numeric metrics permitted for a greater differentiation in calibration than was permissible by visual inspection of graphical calibration curves.},

Active brain metastases, a higher number of metastatic sites, lower albumin and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, higher total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV), and higher ctDNA levels were associated with worse survival. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \&ge; 2ULN (upper limit of normal), CRP \&ge; 10ULN, or ALC \&lt; 750/mm3 delineate a subpopulation where treatment with pembrolizumab is futile. A TMTV \&ge; 80 mL encompassed 17/21 patients with LDH \&ge; 2ULN, CRP \&ge; 10ULN, or ALC \&lt; 750/mm3. No significant associations were observed between baseline GEP scores and survival. Conclusion: Multiple baseline variables correlate with survival on pembrolizumab. TMTV is a more comprehensive baseline biomarker than CRP, LDH, or ALC in predicting the futility of pembrolizumab.},

To improve prediction of VTE in cancer patients, we performed a prospective and observational cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed cancer or progression of disease after remission. A previously developed risk scoring model for prediction of VTE that included clinical (tumor entity and body mass index) and laboratory (hemoglobin level and thrombocyte and leukocyte count) parameters was expanded by incorporating 2 biomarkers, soluble P-selectin, and D-Dimer. Of 819 patients 61 (7.4\%) experienced VTE during a median follow-up of 656 days. The cumulative VTE probability in the original risk model after 6 months was 17.7\% in patients with the highest risk score (≥ 3, n = 93), 9.6\% in those with score 2 (n = 221), 3.8\% in those with score 1 (n = 229), and 1.5\% in those with score 0 (n = 276). In the expanded risk model, the cumulative VTE probability after 6 months in patients with the highest score (≥ 5, n = 30) was 35.0\% and 10.3\% in those with an intermediate score (score 3, n = 130) as opposed to only 1.0\% in patients with score 0 (n = 200); the hazard ratio of patients with the highest compared with those with the lowest score was 25.9 (8.0-84.6). Clinical and standard laboratory parameters with addition of biomarkers enable prediction of VTE and allow identification of cancer patients at high or low risk of VTE.},

  abstract = {This review aims to describe the role and the results of catheter-based renal nerve ablation for the treatment of resistant hypertension. Despite the availability of multiple classes of orally active antihypertensive treatments, resistant hypertension remains an important public health issue in 2012 due to its prevalence and association with target-organ damage and poor prognosis. The failure of purely pharmacological approaches to treat resistant hypertension has stimulated interest in invasive device-based treatments based on old concepts. In the absence of orally active antihypertensive agents, patients with severe and complicated hypertension were widely treated by surgical denervation of the kidney until the 1960s, but this approach was associated with a high incidence of severe adverse events and a high mortality rate. A new catheter system using radiofrequency energy has been developed, allowing an endovascular approach to renal denervation and providing patients with resistant hypertension with a new therapeutic option that is less invasive than surgery and can be performed rapidly under local anaesthesia. To date, this technique has been evaluated only in open-label trials including small numbers of highly selected resistant hypertensive patients with suitable renal artery anatomy. The available evidence suggests a favourable blood pressure-lowering effect in the short term (6 months) and a low incidence of immediate local and endovascular complications. This follow-up period is, however, too short for the detection of rare or late-onset adverse events. For the time being, the benefit/risk ratio of this technique remains to be evaluated, precluding its uncontrolled and widespread use in routine practice.},

Screening may reduce the risk of death from lung cancer.Objective~To conduct a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). A multisociety collaborative initiative (involving the American Cancer Society, American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) was undertaken to create the foundation for development of an evidence-based clinical guideline.Data Sources~MEDLINE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), EMBASE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), and the Cochrane Library (April 2012).Study Selection~Of 591 citations identified and reviewed, 8 randomized trials and 13 cohort studies of LDCT screening met criteria for inclusion. Primary outcomes were lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included nodule detection, invasive procedures, follow-up tests, and smoking cessation.Data Extraction~Critical appraisal using predefined criteria was conducted on individual studies and the overall body of evidence. Differences in data extracted by reviewers were adjudicated by consensus.Results~Three randomized studies provided evidence on the effect of LDCT screening on lung cancer mortality, of which the National Lung Screening Trial was the most informative, demonstrating that among 53~454 participants enrolled, screening resulted in significantly fewer lung cancer deaths (356 vs 443 deaths; lung cancer−specific mortality, 247 vs 309 events per 100~000 person-years for LDCT and control groups, respectively; relative risk, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.93; absolute risk reduction, 0.33\%; P~=~.004). The other 2 smaller studies showed no such benefit. In terms of potential harms of LDCT screening, across all trials and cohorts, approximately 20\% of individuals in each round of screening had positive results requiring some degree of follow-up, while approximately 1\% had lung cancer. There was marked heterogeneity in this finding and in the frequency of follow-up investigations, biopsies, and percentage of surgical procedures performed in patients with benign lesions. Major complications in those with benign conditions were rare.Conclusion~Low-dose computed tomography screening may benefit individuals at an increased risk for lung cancer, but uncertainty exists about the potential harms of screening and the generalizability of results.},

  abstract = {Hip fractures are a leading cause of death and disability among older adults. Hip fractures are also the most commonly missed diagnosis on pelvic radiographs, and delayed diagnosis leads to higher cost and worse outcomes. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms have shown promise for helping radiologists detect fractures, but the image features underpinning their predictions are notoriously difficult to understand. In this study, we trained deep-learning models on 17,587 radiographs to classify fracture, 5 patient traits, and 14 hospital process variables. All 20 variables could be individually predicted from a radiograph, with the best performances on scanner model (AUC\,=\,1.00), scanner brand (AUC\,=\,0.98), and whether the order was marked "priority" (AUC\,=\,0.79). Fracture was predicted moderately well from the image (AUC\,=\,0.78) and better when combining image features with patient data (AUC\,=\,0.86, DeLong paired AUC comparison, p\,=\,2e-9) or patient data plus hospital process features (AUC\,=\,0.91, p\,=\,1e-21). Fracture prediction on a test set that balanced fracture risk across patient variables was significantly lower than a random test set (AUC\,=\,0.67, DeLong unpaired AUC comparison, p\,=\,0.003); and on a test set with fracture risk balanced across patient and hospital process variables, the model performed randomly (AUC\,=\,0.52, 95\% CI 0.46-0.58), indicating that these variables were the main source of the model's fracture predictions. A single model that directly combines image features, patient, and hospital process data outperforms a Naive Bayes ensemble of an image-only model prediction, patient, and hospital process data. If CAD algorithms are inexplicably leveraging patient and process variables in their predictions, it is unclear how radiologists should interpret their predictions in the context of other known patient data. Further research is needed to illuminate deep-learning decision processes so that computers and clinicians can effectively cooperate.},

  abstract = {Background: In medical imaging, prior studies have demonstrated disparate AI performance by race, yet there is no known correlation for race on medical imaging that would be obvious to the human expert interpreting the images. Methods: Using private and public datasets we evaluate: A) performance quantification of deep learning models to detect race from medical images, including the ability of these models to generalize to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities, B) assessment of possible confounding anatomic and phenotype population features, such as disease distribution and body habitus as predictors of race, and C) investigation into the underlying mechanism by which AI models can recognize race. Findings: Standard deep learning models can be trained to predict race from medical images with high performance across multiple imaging modalities. Our findings hold under external validation conditions, as well as when models are optimized to perform clinically motivated tasks. We demonstrate this detection is not due to trivial proxies or imaging-related surrogate covariates for race, such as underlying disease distribution. Finally, we show that performance persists over all anatomical regions and frequency spectrum of the images suggesting that mitigation efforts will be challenging and demand further study. Interpretation: We emphasize that model ability to predict self-reported race is itself not the issue of importance. However, our findings that AI can trivially predict self-reported race -- even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images -- in a setting where clinical experts cannot, creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model secretly used its knowledge of self-reported race to misclassify all Black patients, radiologists would not be able to tell using the same data the model has access to.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that excessive loss of skeletal muscle mass is detrimental. Depletion of muscle mass is associated with poor prognosis in diabetes, trauma, sepsis, lung disease, renal failure and heart failure. In this review we discuss the emergence of muscle mass measurement using diagnostic imaging and the relationship between muscle mass and clinical outcome. The pursuit of specific biochemical targets for reversal of muscle wasting, has spawned a host of investigator initiated research on muscle wasting as well as investigational new drug programs in pharmaceutical companies. Research on therapeutics targeting muscle is to a large extent done in animal models, with relatively few investigations done using human muscle or reporting upon muscle mass or muscle-related outcomes in humans. Since ∼1990, a quantitative approach, as opposed to a purely functional approach, to muscle atrophy and hypertrophy has become accessible with the advent of image-based assessments (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging). These methods have high specificity and precision. In conclusion, current imaging techniques allow us to quantify the degree of muscularity of different individuals, to relate muscle mass to disease-specific outcomes, to define sarcopenia [severe muscle depletion] in quantitative terms, to detect the prevalence and rates of catabolic loss of muscle, the behavior of specific individual muscles and to define the efficacy of different therapies developed for the treatment of muscle wasting.

The efferent sympathetic innervation reaches all the segments of the renal vasculature and to a much lesser extent the tubular nephron.

The pathways of the renal innervation to the corresponding ganglia, as reported from observations resulting from the combination of axonal transport labeling and immunocytochemical methods, are presented. In the rat the ganglia of origin of the sympathetic efferent innervation include T13-L1 ipsilateral and contralateral paravertebral ganglia and the prevertebral superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia. The sensory afferent innervation presents a different segmental distribution of the dorsal root ganglia for the right and left kidney. For the left kidney, the corresponding ganglia extend from T8 to L2 with the greatest numbers in T12 and T13. For the right kidney, ganglia as high as T6 and as low as L2 harbor neurons innervating the kidney. Current knowledge of the anatomical bases of the function of the renal nerves is discussed.},

The availability of multiple heterogeneous datasets presents new opportunities to big data analysts, because the knowledge that can be acquired from combined data would not be possible from any individual source alone. However, the biases that emerge in heterogeneous environments require new analytical tools. Some of these biases, including confounding, sampling selection, and cross-population biases, have been addressed in isolation, largely in restricted parametric models. We here present a general, nonparametric framework for handling these biases and, ultimately, a theoretical solution to the problem of data fusion in causal inference tasks.}

Renal dopamine levels were higher in SHRs aged 6 and 14 weeks in comparison with age-matched WKY rats. Noradrenaline concentrations were similar in 6-week-old SHRs and normotensive WKY rats, and increased slightly in SHRs aged 14 weeks. 3. The density of [3H]-spiperone binding sites was similar in SHRs and WKY rats at 6 weeks of age, and decreased in SHRs at 14 weeks in comparison with age-matched normotensive animals. Light microscope autoradiography revealed the accumulation of silver grains in the tunica adventitia, in the adventitia-media border of intrarenal arteries and within cortical tubules. A few specific silver grains were also developed in the glomerular tuft. No changes in the density and pattern of silver grains were noticeable between SHRs and WKY rats at 6 weeks of age, whereas a reduction in silver grains largely affecting vascular binding sites was observed at 14 weeks of age. 4. Renal denervation considerably decreased the density of [3H]-spiperone binding sites in sections of rat kidney, with an almost complete loss of vascular binding sites. 5. The above findings indicate the occurrence of a decrease of dopamine D2-like receptors in the kidney of SHRs with the progress of hypertension. Dopamine D2-like receptors which are mainly prejunctional are involved in the modulation of sympathetic neurotransmission in the kidney. The loss of these receptors in SHRs may contribute to the pathophysiology of hypertension.}

  abstract = {Objectives To conduct a systematic review of studies externally validating the ADNEX (Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the adnexa) model for diagnosis of ovarian cancer and to present a meta-analysis of its performance. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of external validation studies Data sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Europe PMC, from 15 October 2014 to 15 May 2023. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies All external validation studies of the performance of ADNEX, with any study design and any study population of patients with an adnexal mass. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Reporting quality of the studies was scored with the TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) reporting guideline, and methodological conduct and risk of bias with PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool). Random effects meta-analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity at the 10\% risk of malignancy threshold, and net benefit and relative utility at the 10\% risk of malignancy threshold were performed. Results 47 studies (17 007 tumours) were included, with a median study sample size of 261 (range 24-4905). On average, 61\% of TRIPOD items were reported. Handling of missing data, justification of sample size, and model calibration were rarely described. 91\% of validations were at high risk of bias, mainly because of the unexplained exclusion of incomplete cases, small sample size, or no assessment of calibration. The summary AUC to distinguish benign from malignant tumours in patients who underwent surgery was 0.93 (95\% confidence interval 0.92 to 0.94, 95\% prediction interval 0.85 to 0.98) for ADNEX with the serum biomarker, cancer antigen 125 (CA125), as a predictor (9202 tumours, 43 centres, 18 countries, and 21 studies) and 0.93 (95\% confidence interval 0.91 to 0.94, 95\% prediction interval 0.85 to 0.98) for ADNEX without CA125 (6309 tumours, 31 centres, 13 countries, and 12 studies). The estimated probability that the model has use clinically in a new centre was 95\% (with CA125) and 91\% (without CA125). When restricting analysis to studies with a low risk of bias, summary AUC values were 0.93 (with CA125) and 0.91 (without CA125), and estimated probabilities that the model has use clinically were 89\% (with CA125) and 87\% (without CA125). Conclusions The results of the meta-analysis indicated that ADNEX performed well in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumours in populations from different countries and settings, regardless of whether the serum biomarker, CA125, was used as a predictor. A key limitation was that calibration was rarely assessed. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42022373182.},

For clinical use, it is essential that these features provide robust measurements. Studies with phantoms and simulated lower dose levels have demonstrated that radiomic features can vary with different radiation dose levels. This study presents an in vivo stability analysis of radiomic features for pulmonary nodules against varying radiation dose levels. METHODS: Nineteen patients with a total of thirty-five pulmonary nodules underwent four chest CT scans at different radiation dose levels (60, 33, 24, and 15 mAs) in a single session. The nodules were manually delineated. To assess the robustness of features, we calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). To visualize the effect of milliampere-second variation on groups of features, a linear model was fitted to each feature. We calculated bias and calculated the R2 value as a measure of goodness of fit. RESULTS: A small minority of 15/100 (15\%) radiomic features were considered stable (ICC\,{$>$}\,0.9). Bias increased and R2~decreased at lower dose, but shape features seemed to be more robust to milliampere-second variations than other feature classes. CONCLUSION: A large majority of pulmonary nodule radiomic features were not inherently robust to radiation dose level variations. For a subset of features, it was possible to correct this variability by a simple linear model. However, the correction became increasingly less accurate at lower radiation dose levels. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Radiomic features provide a quantitative description of a tumor based on medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT). These features are potentially useful in several clinical tasks such as diagnosis, prognosis prediction, treatment effect monitoring, and treatment effect estimation. KEY POINTS: • The vast majority of commonly used radiomic features are strongly influenced by variations in radiation dose level. • A small minority of radiomic features, notably the shape feature class, are robust against dose-level variations according to ICC calculations. • A large subset of radiomic features can be corrected by a linear model taking into account only the radiation dose level.},

  abstract = {Missing covariate data commonly occur in epidemiological and clinical research, and are often dealt with using multiple imputation. Imputation of partially observed covariates is complicated if the substantive model is non-linear (e.g. Cox proportional hazards model), or contains non-linear (e.g. squared) or interaction terms, and standard software implementations of multiple imputation may impute covariates from models that are incompatible with such substantive models. We show how imputation by fully conditional specification, a popular approach for performing multiple imputation, can be modified so that covariates are imputed from models which are compatible with the substantive model. We investigate through simulation the performance of this proposal, and compare it with existing approaches. Simulation results suggest our proposal gives consistent estimates for a range of common substantive models, including models which contain non-linear covariate effects or interactions, provided data are missing at random and the assumed imputation models are correctly specified and mutually compatible. Stata software implementing the approach is freely available.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 1997 and February 2003, 71 patients  with Stage III NSCLC were treated with radiation therapy of 60 Gy or more. The total  target dose was between 60 and 77 Gy (average, 66.3 Gy). Chemotherapy was used in 45  cases. The primary tumor and nodal volume were identified in pretreatment computed  tomography scans. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the  impact of tumor volume on survival after RT. RESULTS: The overall 2-year survival  rate was 23\%, with a median survival time of 14 months. The median survival times  were 10 months and 19 months with large primary tumor volume more than median volume  and smaller primary tumor volume, respectively. At a univariate analysis, the total  tumor volume (TTV) (p{$<$}0.0003) and the primary tumor volume (p{$<$}0.00008) were  significant and the nodal volume was not. At multivariate analyses, both the TTV and  the primary tumor volume were significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The  primary tumor volume as well as TTV is a significant prognostic factor on survival  in patients with Stage III NSCLC treated with RT and should be recorded in clinical  results when the survivals are compared among clinical studies.},

Studies on lung cancer have shown that texture analysis may have a role in characterizing tumors and predicting patient outcome. This article outlines the mathematic basis of and the most recent literature on texture analysis in lung cancer imaging. We also describe the challenges facing the clinical implementation of texture analysis. CONCLUSION: Texture analysis of lung cancer images has been applied successfully to FDG PET and CT scans. Different texture parameters have been shown to be predictive of the nature of disease and of patient outcome. In general, it appears that more heterogeneous tumors on imaging tend to be more aggressive and to be associated with poorer outcomes and that tumor heterogeneity on imaging decreases with treatment. Despite these promising results, there is a large variation in the reported data and strengths of association.},

  abstract = {Purpose: We assessed the predictive potential of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT-based radiomics, lesion volume, and routine blood markers for early differentiation of pseudoprogression from true progression at 3 months. Experimental Design: 112 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibition were included in our study. Median follow-up duration was 22 months. 716 metastases were segmented individually on CT and 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET imaging at three timepoints: baseline (TP0), 3 months (TP1), and 6 months (TP2). Response was defined on a lesion-individual level (RECIST 1.1) and retrospectively correlated with FDG-PET/CT radiomic features and the blood markers LDH/S100. Seven multivariate prediction model classes were generated. Results: Two-year (median) overall survival, progression-free survival, and immune progression–free survival were 69\% (not reached), 24\% (6 months), and 42\% (16 months), respectively. At 3 months, 106 (16\%) lesions had progressed, of which 30 (5\%) were identified as pseudoprogression at 6 months. Patients with pseudoprogressive lesions and without true progressive lesions had a similar outcome to responding patients and a significantly better 2-year overall survival of 100\% (30 months), compared with 15\% (10 months) in patients with true progressions/without pseudoprogression (P = 0.002). Patients with mixed progressive/pseudoprogressive lesions were in between at 53\% (25 months). The blood prediction model (LDH+S100) achieved an AUC = 0.71. Higher LDH/S100 values indicated a low chance of pseudoprogression. Volume-based models: AUC = 0.72 (TP1) and AUC = 0.80 (delta-volume between TP0/TP1). Radiomics models (including/excluding volume-related features): AUC = 0.79/0.78. Combined blood/volume model: AUC = 0.79. Combined blood/radiomics model (including volume-related features): AUC = 0.78. The combined blood/radiomics model (excluding volume-related features) performed best: AUC = 0.82. Conclusions: Noninvasive PET/CT-based radiomics, especially in combination with blood parameters, are promising biomarkers for early differentiation of pseudoprogression, potentially avoiding added toxicity or delayed treatment switch.},

  abstract = {166Ho-microspheres have recently been approved for clinical use for hepatic radioembolization in the European Union. The aim of this study was to investigate the absorbed dose–response relationship and its association with overall survival for 166Ho radioembolization in patients with liver metastases. Methods: Patients treated in the HEPAR I and II studies who underwent an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan at baseline, a posttreatment 166Ho SPECT/CT scan, and another 18F-FDG PET/CT scan at the 3-mo follow-up were included for analysis. The posttreatment 166Ho-microsphere activity distributions were estimated with quantitative SPECT/CT reconstructions using a quantitative Monte Carlo–based method. The response of each tumor was based on the change in total lesion glycolysis (TLG) between baseline and follow-up and was placed into 1 of 4 categories, according to the PERCIST criteria, ranging from complete response to progressive disease. Patient-level response was grouped according to the average change in TLG per patient. The absorbed dose–response relationship was assessed using a linear mixed model to account for correlation of tumors within patients. Median overall survival was compared between patients with and without a metabolic liver response, using a log-rank test. Results: Thirty-six patients with a total of 98 tumors were included. The relation between tumor-absorbed dose and both tumor-level and patient-level response was explored. At a tumor level, a significant difference in geometric mean absorbed dose was found between complete response (232 Gy; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 178–303 Gy; n = 32) and stable disease (147 Gy; 95\% CI, 113–191 Gy; n = 28) (P = 0.01) and between complete response and progressive disease (117 Gy; 95\% CI, 87–159 Gy; n = 21) (P = 0.0008). This constitutes a robust absorbed dose–response relationship. At a patient level, a significant difference was found between patients with complete or partial response (210 Gy; 95\% CI, 161–274 Gy; n = 13) and patients with progressive disease (116 Gy; 95\% CI, 81–165 Gy; n = 9) (P = 0.01). Patients were subsequently grouped according to their average change in TLG. Patients with an objective response (complete or partial) exhibited a significantly higher overall survival than nonresponding patients (stable or progressive disease) (median, 19 mo vs. 7.5 mo; log-rank, P = 0.01). Conclusion: These results confirm a significant absorbed dose–response relationship in 166Ho radioembolization. Treatment response is associated with a higher overall survival.},

Because of the poor power of the study no significant differences in median survival (MS), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) could be detected. MS was 16.2 (S) and 16.5 (C) months, 2-year OS was 34\% (S) and 39\% (C), 3-year OS was 22\% (S) and 34\% (C). CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy 66Gy given concurrently with daily low-dose Cisplatin or after two courses of Gemcitabine/Cisplatin was well tolerated. Due to early closure no conclusions can be reached on the relative merits; both arms showed good OS.},

  abstract = {Doubly robust estimators are widely used to draw inference about the average effect of a treatment. Such estimators are consistent for the effect of interest if either one of two nuisance parameters is consistently estimated. However, if flexible, data-adaptive estimators of these nuisance parameters are used, double robustness does not readily extend to inference. We present a general theoretical study of the behaviour of doubly robust estimators of an average treatment effect when one of the nuisance parameters is inconsistently estimated. We contrast different methods for constructing such estimators and investigate the extent to which they may be modified to also allow doubly robust inference. We find that while targeted minimum loss-based estimation can be used to solve this problem very naturally, common alternative frameworks appear to be inappropriate for this purpose. We provide a theoretical study and a numerical evaluation of the alternatives considered. Our simulations highlight the need for and usefulness of these approaches in practice, while our theoretical developments have broad implications for the construction of estimators that permit doubly robust inference in other problems.}

In resections for sigmoid disease, the surgeon often has the choice of using either the distal sigmoid colon or the upper rectum for the distal portion of the anastomosis. We examined the courses of 501 consecutive patients who had resection and anastomosis for diverticular disease at the Mayo Clinic between 1970 and 1975. Recurrent diverticulitis developed in 12.5 percent of the patients in whom the sigmoid colon had been used for the distal margin of anastomosis and in 6.7 percent of those in whom the rectum had been used (p = 0.03). Reoperation was required in 3.4 percent of the patients in whom the sigmoid colon was used as the distal anastomotic site and in 2.2 percent of those in whom the rectum had been used (p {$>$} 0.05). We found no increase in anastomotic leaks or other perioperative complications in patients in whom the rectum had been mobilized. We conclude that the entire distal sigmoid colon should be removed during resection for diverticular disease and anastomosed to the upper rectum to avoid recurrent diverticulitis.},

  abstract = {Programmed cell death protein-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) blockade is effective in a subset of patients with several tumor types, but predicting patient benefit using approved diagnostics is inexact, as some patients with PD-L1-negative tumors also show clinical benefit1,2. Moreover, all biopsy-based tests are subject to the errors and limitations of invasive tissue collection3–11. Preclinical studies of positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging with antibodies to PD-L1 suggested that this imaging method might be an approach to selecting patients12,13. Such a technique, however, requires substantial clinical development and validation. Here we present the initial results from a first-in-human study to assess the feasibility of imaging with zirconium-89-labeled atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), including biodistribution, and secondly test its potential to predict response to PD-L1 blockade (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02453984 and NCT02478099). We imaged 22 patients across three tumor types before the start of atezolizumab therapy. The PET signal, a function of tracer exposure and target expression, was high in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation. In tumors, uptake was generally high but heterogeneous, varying within and among lesions, patients, and tumor types. Intriguingly, clinical responses in our patients were better correlated with pretreatment PET signal than with immunohistochemistry- or RNA-sequencing-based predictive biomarkers, encouraging further development of molecular PET imaging for assessment of PD-L1 status and clinical response prediction.},

  abstract = {Background: Extent of bowel resection and level of anastomosis are unsettled issues of surgery for diverticulitis of the sigmoid. The aim of this study was to compare the adequacy of open colon resection (OCR) with that of laparoscopic colon resection (LCR) for uncomplicated diverticulitis of the sigmoid (UDS), specifically addressing level of anastomosis and length of specimen. Methods: Comparisons were made between 40 selected patients undergoing LCR for UDS between 1992 and 1994 and 35 diagnosis-matched controls who previously underwent OCR by the same surgeons at the same institution. Results: The OCR and LCR patients were well-matched for age, gender, weight, ASA grade, duration of symptoms, and number of previous admissions. There were no significant differences, respectively, between OCR and LCR patients in morbidity rates (2 vs. 5, p= 0.33) and rates of mobilization of the splenic flexure (17:18 vs. 29:11, p {$<$} 0.1). Specimen length (18 cm vs. 11 cm, p≪ 0.01), colosigmoid vs. colorectal anastomosis (24:11 vs. 1:39, p≪ 0.01), and presence of inflammatory cells at the proximal resection margin (2 vs. 11, p= 0.02) were significantly different. The OCR patients had statistically longer follow-up than LCR patients (63 months vs. 46 months, p≪ 0.01). Recurrent diverticulitis rates were 9.6\% and 2.7\% after OCR and LCR, respectively (3 vs. 1, p= 0.73). Conclusions: Inadequate sigmoid resection should prompt diligence to take down the splenic flexure placing the distal anastomotic margin on the rectum to ensure adequate surgery.},

  abstract = {Systemic hypertension is a major burden to the individual and society. Its association with major adverse cardiac and cerebral events and favorable effects of antihypertensive therapy are undisputed. However, despite multidrug therapy, blood pressures are frequently suboptimally controlled. Moreover, adverse drug effects often interfere with patients' lifestyles and affect compliance. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies have been explored. Most recently, attention has been redirected to the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In addition, interruption of the renal SNS in humans with resistant hypertension has been studied with promising results. The following review provides an overview of the anatomy and physiology of the renal SNS, the rational for manipulating the SNS, and the results of therapeutic renal sympathetic denervation.}

  abstract = {Background Melanoma brain metastases historically portend a dismal prognosis, but recent advances in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been associated with durable responses in some patients. There are no validated imaging biomarkers associated with outcomes in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICIs. We hypothesized that radiomic analysis of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) could identify higher-order features associated with survival. Methods Between 2010 and 2019, we retrospectively reviewed patients with melanoma brain metastases who received ICI. After volumes of interest were drawn, several texture and edge descriptors, including first-order, Haralick, Gabor, Sobel, and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) features were extracted. Progression was determined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases. Univariate Cox regression was performed for each radiomic feature with adjustment for multiple comparisons followed by Lasso regression and multivariate analysis. Results Eighty-eight patients with 196 total brain metastases were identified. Median age was 63.5 years (range, 19–91 y). Ninety percent of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and 35\% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Sixty-three patients (72\%) received ipilimumab, 11 patients (13\%) received programmed cell death protein 1 blockade, and 14 patients (16\%) received nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Multiple features were associated with increased overall survival (OS), and LoG edge features best explained the variation in outcome (hazard ratio: 0.68, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, a similar trend with LoG was seen, but no longer significant with OS. Findings were confirmed in an independent cohort. Conclusion Higher-order MRI radiomic features in patients with melanoma brain metastases receiving ICI were associated with a trend toward improved OS.},

  abstract = {Skin cancer is among the most common and lethal cancer types, with the number of cases increasing dramatically worldwide. If not diagnosed in the nascent stages, it can lead to metastases, resulting in high mortality rates. Skin cancer can be cured if detected early. Consequently, timely and accurate diagnosis of such cancers is currently a key research objective. Various machine learning technologies have been employed in computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer detection and malignancy classification. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) involving models and algorithms which can learn from data and generate predictions on previously unseen data. The traditional biopsy method is applied to diagnose skin cancer, which is a tedious and expensive procedure. Alternatively, machine learning algorithms for cancer diagnosis can aid in its early detection, lowering the workload of specialists while simultaneously enhancing skin lesion diagnostics. This article presented a critical review of select state-of-the-art machine learning techniques used to detect skin cancer. Several studies had been collected, and an analysis of the performance of k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and convolutional neural networks algorithms on benchmark datasets was conducted. The shortcomings and disadvantages of each algorithm were briefly discussed. Challenges in detecting skin cancer were highlighted and the scope for future research was proposed.},

  abstract = {Advances in multiplexed imaging technologies have drastically improved our ability to characterize healthy and diseased tissues at the single-cell level. Co-detection by indexing (CODEX) relies on DNA-conjugated antibodies and the cyclic addition and removal of complementary fluorescently labeled DNA probes and has been used so far to simultaneously visualize up to 60 markers in situ. CODEX enables a deep view into the single-cell spatial relationships in tissues and is intended to spur discovery in developmental biology, disease and therapeutic design. Herein, we provide optimized protocols for conjugating purified antibodies to DNA oligonucleotides, validating the conjugation by CODEX staining and executing the CODEX multicycle imaging procedure for both formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh-frozen tissues. In addition, we describe basic image processing and data analysis procedures. We apply this approach to an FFPE human tonsil multicycle experiment. The hands-on experimental time for antibody conjugation is \textasciitilde 4.5 h, validation of DNA-conjugated antibodies with CODEX staining takes \textasciitilde 6.5 h and preparation for a CODEX multicycle experiment takes \textasciitilde 8 h. The multicycle imaging and data analysis time depends on the tissue size, number of markers in the panel and computational complexity.},

  abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) is routinely used in clinical practice to evaluate a wide variety of medical conditions. While CT scans provide diagnoses, they also offer the ability to extract quantitative body composition metrics to analyze tissue volume and quality. Extracting quantitative body composition measures manually from CT scans is a cumbersome and time-consuming task. Proprietary software has been developed recently to automate this process, but the closed-source nature impedes widespread use. There is a growing need for fully automated body composition software that is more accessible and easier to use, especially for clinicians and researchers who are not experts in medical image processing. To this end, we have built Comp2Comp, an open-source Python package for rapid and automated body composition analysis of CT scans. This package offers models, post-processing heuristics, body composition metrics, automated batching, and polychromatic visualizations. Comp2Comp currently computes body composition measures for bone, skeletal muscle, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue on CT scans of the abdomen. We have created two pipelines for this purpose. The first pipeline computes vertebral measures, as well as muscle and adipose tissue measures, at the T12 - L5 vertebral levels from abdominal CT scans. The second pipeline computes muscle and adipose tissue measures on user-specified 2D axial slices. In this guide, we discuss the architecture of the Comp2Comp pipelines, provide usage instructions, and report internal and external validation results to measure the quality of segmentations and body composition measures.

  abstract = {Calibration measures and reliability diagrams are two fundamental tools for measuring and interpreting the calibration of probabilistic predictors. Calibration measures quantify the degree of miscalibration, and reliability diagrams visualize the structure of this miscalibration. However, the most common constructions of reliability diagrams and calibration measures -- binning and ECE -- both suffer from well-known flaws (e.g. discontinuity). We show that a simple modification fixes both constructions: first smooth the observations using an RBF kernel, then compute the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of this smoothed function. We prove that with a careful choice of bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the sense of (B\{\textbackslash l\}asiok, Gopalan, Hu, and Nakkiran 2023a) -- a consistent calibration measure. We call this measure the SmoothECE. Moreover, the reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the BinnedECE. We also provide a Python package with simple, hyperparameter-free methods for measuring and plotting calibration: `pip install relplot\textbackslash `.},

  abstract = {We study the fundamental question of how to define and measure the distance from calibration for probabilistic predictors. While the notion of perfect calibration is well-understood, there is no consensus on how to quantify the distance from perfect calibration. Numerous calibration measures have been proposed in the literature, but it is unclear how they compare to each other, and many popular measures such as Expected Calibration Error (ECE) fail to satisfy basic properties like continuity. We present a rigorous framework for analyzing calibration measures, inspired by the literature on property testing. We propose a ground-truth notion of distance from calibration: the \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$ distance to the nearest perfectly calibrated predictor. We define a consistent calibration measure as one that is polynomially related to this distance. Applying our framework, we identify three calibration measures that are consistent and can be estimated efficiently: smooth calibration, interval calibration, and Laplace kernel calibration. The former two give quadratic approximations to the ground truth distance, which we show is information-theoretically optimal in a natural model for measuring calibration which we term the prediction-only access model. Our work thus establishes fundamental lower and upper bounds on measuring the distance to calibration, and also provides theoretical justification for preferring certain metrics (like Laplace kernel calibration) in practice.},

  abstract = {In the present study the topographical distribution of the intrinsic nerve plexuses of the basal cerebral arteries in humans was quantified and the relation between vessel diameter and nerve density was investigated. Whole-mount preparations of various segments of the basal cerebral arteries from middle-aged patients were stained for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5. The deep nerve plexuses, located at the adventitial-medial border, were quantified by image analysis. Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to study nerve plexuses throughout the adventitia. Transverse cryostat sections were stained for PGP 9.5, tyrosine hydroxylase and neurofilament, and quantified. The results showed a three-layered configuration of the adventitial nerves. Measurements on whole-mounts demonstrated that nerve densities were highest in the posterior communicating artery (PCom), and next highest in the proximal parts of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and anterior choroidal artery. There appeared to be no clear relation between nerve density and vessel diameter. The measurements on sections confirmed the high nerve densities in the PCom and PCA. Tyrosine hydroxylase- and neurofilament-immunoreactivities appeared to demonstrate separate subpopulations of the overall nerve plexuses, representing sympathetic and, possibly, sensory fibers, respectively. Densities of both subgroups generally followed those of PGP 9.5-immunoreactive nerves. Transmission electron microscopy suggested motor function of the deep nerve plexuses. The results indicate a stronger neuronal influence on this part of the cerebral circulation than hitherto reported. It is concluded that human basal cerebral arteries display a topographical distribution of deep perivascular nerves, and that nerve density is determined by locality rather than by vascular diameter.},

Michael, K.M. Knigge, and S.R. Vincent, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2811-2814, '91). We provide histochemical evidence for the existence of a neuron-specific NOS-activity in autonomic neurons of the thoracic spinal cord. Among the four main preganglionic cell clusters investigated at mid-thoracic levels, Th7-10, the intermediolateral (IML)-cell column was the most prominently stained cell group. The histochemical staining was absent in other spinal cord neurons and non-neuronal cells, e.g., GFAP-positive glial cells. Staining was completely blocked by N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), a potent NOS-inhibitor for brain and peripheral autonomic neurons, but was still observed in the presence of another NOS-inhibitor, N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine (MeArg). The NOS-activity co-localized with nearly half of the ChAT-immunostained neurons located in the mid-thoracic IML-cell column as quantified by cell counts in single and double-stained tissue sections. We conclude that NOS-activity-containing neurons represent a distinct group among cholinergic IML-neurons, which suggests a more general function of this newly defined subpopulation of the spinal cord autonomic system. In vivo Fast blue retrograde labeling combined with histochemical staining and immunostaining revealed that sympathoadrenal projection neurons belong to the distinct NOS and ChAT-positive IML-cell group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {When predicting a target variable \$Y\$ from features \$X\$, the prediction \$\textbackslash hat\{Y\}\$ can be performative: an agent might act on this prediction, affecting the value of \$Y\$ that we eventually observe. Performative predictions are deliberately prevalent in algorithmic decision support, where a decision support system (DSS) provides a prediction for an agent to affect the value of the target variable. When deploying a DSS in high-stakes settings (e.g. healthcare, law, predictive policing, or child welfare screening) it is imperative to carefully assess the performative effects of the DSS. In the case that the DSS serves as an alarm for a predicted negative outcome, naive retraining of the prediction model is bound to result in a model that underestimates the risk, due to effective workings of the previous model. In this work, we propose to model the deployment of a DSS as causal domain shift and provide novel cross-domain identification results for the conditional expectation \$E[Y|X]\$, allowing for pre- and post-hoc assessment of the deployment of the DSS, and for re-training of a model that assesses the risk under a baseline policy where the DSS is not deployed. Using a running example, we empirically show that a repeated regression procedure provides a practical framework for estimating these quantities, even when the data is affected by sample selection bias and selective labelling, offering for a practical, unified solution for multiple forms of target variable bias.},

Rules of identification are available, but do not include all models encountered in practice. In this article we provide 2 rules of identification: the 2+ emitted paths rule and the exogenous X rule. The former is a necessary condition of identification and the latter is a sufficient condition. We explain and prove each of these rules and provide illustrations of their application. These rules extend the coverage of structural equation models that we can check for identification.

  abstract = {Purpose The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the gold standard for establishing new therapies in clinical oncology. Here we document changes with time in design, sponsorship, and outcomes of oncology RCTs. Methods Reports of RCTs evaluating systemic therapy for breast, colorectal (CRC), and non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) published 1975 to 2004 in six major journals were reviewed. Two authors abstracted data regarding trial design, results, and conclusions. Conclusions of authors were graded using a 7-point Likert scale. For each study the effect size for the primary end point was converted to a summary measure. Results A total of 321 eligible RCTs were included (48\% breast, 24\% CRC, 28\% NSCLC). Over time, the number and size of RCTs increased considerably. For-profit/mixed sponsorship increased substantially during the study period (4\% to 57\%; P {$<$} .001). There was increasing use of time-to-event measures (39\% to 78\%) and decreasing use of response rate (54\% to 14\%) as primary end point (P {$<$} .001). Effect size remained stable over the study period. Authors have become more likely to strongly endorse the experimental arm (P = .017). A significant P value for the primary end point and industry sponsorship were each independently associated with endorsement of the experimental agent (odds ratio [OR] = 19.6, 95\% CI, 8.9 to 43.1, and OR = 3.5, 95\% CI, 1.6 to 7.5, respectively). Conclusion RCTs in oncology have become larger and are more likely to be sponsored by industry. Authors of modern RCTs are more likely to strongly endorse novel therapies. For-profit sponsorship and statistically significant results are independently associated with endorsement of the experimental arm.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Estimation of vancomycin area under the curve (AUC) is challenging in the case of discontinuous administration. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used and can be an alternative to population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) approaches for AUC estimation. The objectives were to train XGBoost algorithms based on simulations performed in a previous POPPK study to predict vancomycin AUC from early concentrations and a few features (i.e. patient information) and to evaluate them in a real-life external dataset in comparison to POPPK. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six thousand simulations performed from 6 different POPPK models were split into training and test sets. XGBoost algorithms were trained to predict trapezoidal rule AUC a priori or based on 2, 4 or 6 samples and were evaluated by resampling in the training set and validated in the test set. Finally, the 2-sample algorithm was externally evaluated on 28 real patients and compared to a state-of-the-art POPPK model-based averaging approach. RESULTS: The trained algorithms showed excellent performances in the test set with relative mean prediction error (MPE)/ imprecision (RMSE) of the reference AUC\,=\,3.3/18.9, 2.8/17.4, 1.3/13.7\% for the 2, 4 and 6 samples algorithms respectively. Validation in real patient showed flexibility in sampling time post-treatment initiation and excellent performances MPE/RMSE{$<$}1.5/12\% for the 2 samples algorithm in comparison to different POPPK approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The Xgboost algorithm trained from simulation and evaluated in real patients allow accurate and precise prediction of vancomycin AUC. It can be used in combination with POPPK models to increase the confidence in AUC estimation.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiota impacts response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. We sought to evaluate the role of physiologic colonic fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake, a test that was recently shown to reflect colonic bacterial load, as a possible predictor for response to immunotherapy. We carried out a retrospective study in metastatic melanoma patients who received the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab as first-line therapy. All patients underwent an 18F-FDG PET scan before treatment initiation. The primary outcome was defined as response to treatment according to the RECIST criteria. Regions of interest were drawn on each transaxial slice around the outer boundaries of the colon. Uptake was measured using maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUV). A nonparametric test was used to compare SUV between response groups. The study included 14 melanoma patients, of whom two (14.3\%) achieved a complete response (CR) following treatment, eight (57.1\%) achieved a partial response (PR), and four (28.6\%) developed progressive disease (PD). The mean SUVmax was 1.33±0.04, 2.2±0.46, and 3.33±2.67 for individuals with CR, PR, and PD, respectively. The difference between individuals with CR and those without CR (PR or PD) in total colonic SUVmax was statistically significant (P=0.03). Thus, physiologic colonic 18F-FDG uptake may predict CR to immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma patients.},

  abstract = {Aims If appropriate patients are to be selected for lung cancer treatment, an understanding of who is most at risk of adverse outcomes after treatment is needed. The aim of the present study was to identify predictive factors for 30 and 90 day mortality after chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and factors that were prognostic for overall survival. Materials and methods A retrospective cohort study of 194 patients with lung cancer who had undergone CRT in South East Scotland from 2008 to 2010 was undertaken. Gender, age, cancer characteristics, weight loss, body mass index (BMI), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; ECOG) and computed tomography-derived body composition variables were examined for prognostic significance using Cox's proportional hazards model and logistic regression. Results The median overall survival was 19 months (95\% confidence interval 16.3, 21.7). Four of 194 patients died within 30 days of treatment completion, for which there were no independent predictive variables; 22/194 (11\%) died within 90 days of treatment completion. BMI {$<$} 20 and ECOG performance status ≥2 were independent predictors of death within 90 days of treatment completion (P = 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Patients with either BMI {$<$} 20 or ECOG performance status ≥ 2 had an odds ratio of death within 90 days of 5.97 (95\% confidence interval 2.20, 16.19), rising to an odds ratio of 13.27 (1.70, 103.47) for patients with both BMI {$<$} 20 and ECOG performance status ≥ 2. Patients with low muscle attenuation had significantly reduced overall survival (P = 0.004); individuals with low muscle attenuation had a median survival of 15.2 months (95\% confidence interval 12.7, 17.7) compared with 23.0 months (95\% confidence interval 18.3, 27.8) for those with high muscle attenuation, equating to a hazard ratio of death of 1.62 (95\% confidence interval 1.17, 2.23, P = 0.003). Conclusion Poor performance status, low BMI and low muscle attenuation identify patients at increased risk of premature death after CRT. Risk factors for adverse outcomes should inform personalised discussions with patients about the potential harms as well as the intended benefits of treatment. © 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists},

BACKGROUND: LVH and diastolic dysfunction are associated with elevated sympathetic activity and increased morbidity and mortality. The effect of RD on LVH and LV function is unclear. METHODS: Forty-six patients underwent bilateral RD, and 18 patients served as controls. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at baseline, and after 1 month and 6 months. RESULTS: Besides reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-22.5/-7.2 mm Hg at 1 month and -27.8/-8.8 mm Hg at 6 months, p {$<$} 0.001 at each time point), RD significantly reduced mean interventricular septum thickness from 14.1 ± 1.9 mm to 13.4 ± 2.1 mm and 12.5 ± 1.4 mm (p = 0.007), and LV mass index from 53.9 ± 15.6 g/m(2.7) (112.4 ± 33.9 g/m(2)) to 47.0 ± 14.2 g/m(2.7) (103.6 ± 30.5 g/m(2)) and 44.7 ± 14.9 g/m(2.7) (94.9 ± 29.8 g/m(2)) (p {$<$} 0.001) at 1 month and 6 months, respectively. The mitral valve lateral E/E' decreased after RD from 9.9 ± 4.0 to 7.9 ± 2.2 at 1 month and 7.4 ± 2.7 at 6 months (p {$<$} 0.001), indicating reduction of LV filling pressures. Isovolumic relaxation time shortened (baseline 109.1 ± 21.7 ms vs. 85.6 ± 24.4 ms at 6 months, p = 0.006), whereas ejection fraction significantly increased after RD (baseline: 63.1 ± 8.1\% vs. 70.1 ± 11.5\% at 6 months, p {$<$} 0.001). No significant changes were obtained in control patients. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the known effect on blood pressure, our study showed for the first time that RD significantly reduces LV mass and improves diastolic function, which might have important prognostic implications in patients with resistant hypertension at high cardiovascular risk.},

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

  abstract = {Résumé L'influence des radiations ionisantes sur les métastases pulmonaires peut être clairement mise en évidence par la mensuration des lésions sur des radiographies successives. Une irradiation fractionnée provoque une réduction concentrique de la taille des métastases. Lorsque la mesure du diamètre est suffisamment précise, il est possible de calculer le pourcentage de réduction de leur volume. De telles études quantitatives ont été faites chez 16 malades. La réduction de volume est déjà évidente quelques jours après l'administration de la première dose. La répétition d'une dose quotidienne constante permet d'établir une courbe exponentielle de survie. La Métastase reprend sa croissance immédiatement après l'arrêt de la série d'irradiations, ou, au plus tard, quelques jours après celui-ci, et avec la même vitesse qu'avant le traitement. Les faits observés sont en accord avec les expériences d'Elkind sur l'irradiation fractionnée des cultures de cellules. Ainsi, la dose létale D37, définie comme la dose laissant 37\% du volume initial de la tumeur capable de reprendre la croissance, peut être calculée chez des patients irradiés par les rayons X à 250 kV ou par le Cobalt60. Les résultats ont montré de grandes différences de radiosensibilité parmi les tumeurs de différents types. Les valeurs de D37 allaient de 300 à 2550 rad. Ces différences ne peuvent être expliquées ni par l'hypothèse que toutes les cellules ont la même radiosensibilité intrinsèque, ni par des différences de la tension d'oxygène dans les tissus. On observa une bonne corrélation entre la radiosensibilité (D37) et la vitesse de croissance d'une tumeur, exprimée par son temps de doublement (T2). Pour tous les cas, l'équation log D37 = 1,780 + 0,652 log T2 correspond aux données observées, dans des limites acceptables. En excluant les valeurs de D37 pour les deux tumeurs aux croissances les plus lentes (T2 {$>$} 150 jours), toutes les valeurs de D37 se répartissent sur une droite correspondant à l'équation D37 = 220 + 10T2. La signification de ces relations est discutée du point de vue de la radiobiologie clinique, et du point de vue de la pratique de la radiothérapie. La possibilité d'estimer la dose létale pour une tumeur, si l'on connaît son volume et sa vitesse de croissance, est d'un intérêt particulier. De nombreuses recherches supplémentaires, dans divers domaines, restent cependant à faire pour atteindre ce but. Pulmonary metastases from different types of tumour in Man show constant growth rates when measured accurately on successive roentgenograms of the chest. The influence of ionizing radiation on these metastatic tumours could be shown very clearly. Fractionated irradiation resulted in a concentric reduction in the size of the metastases, the outlines of which remained remarkably well defined. This made it possible to calculate the percentage of reduction in volume by measuring the change in diameter. Data on such pulmonary metastases in sixteen of our patients were suitable for quantitative analysis. It was found that volume reduction became evident a few days after the first dose was administered. Repetition of the same daily dose caused percentages of reduction, giving an exponential survival curve. After the last dose of a series was given, the tumour resumed in growth immediately, or at least within a few days, at approximately the same rate as before irradiation. The surviving fractions found in these cases did not conflict with the assumption of an exponential survival curve, as constructed by Elkind for fractionated irraditions of cell cultures. In this way, the mean lethal dose D37 defined as the dose leaving 37 per cent of the original volume capable of resuming growth, could be calculated for these irradiations, in which daily doses of 100–150 rads were applied using 250 kV roentgen and Cobalt-60. The results showed wide variations in radiosensitivity amongst tumours of different types (Table 1). Values of D37 extending from 300 up to 2550 rads were encountered. These differences, which correspond to a factor of 8·5 cannot be explained by the assumption that all cells have the same intrinsic radiosensitivity and that all differences observed are caused by differences in oxygen tension in tissues. Good correlation was found to exist between the radiosensitivity (D37) and the growth rate of a tumour, expressed in terms of the doubling time, T2. For all cases, the equation log D37 = 1·780 + 0·652 log T2 fits the data within fair limits. Excluding the value of D37 for two tumours, i.e. those with the lowest growth rate (T2 {$>$} 150 days), all value s of D37 fitted well in a linear correlation according to the equation, D37 = 220 + 10 T2. Possible explanations of the phenomena found are discussed, taking into account the concepts of modern experimental radiobiology. The significance of these relationships for clinical radiobiology and the practice of radiotherapy is considered. The possibility of estimating the lethal dose for a tumour if its volume and growth rate are known is of particular interest. Many additional investigations in various fields will be required to reach this goal, however. Zusammenfassung Lungenmetastasen ausgehend von verschiedenen menschlichen Tumoren, weisen eine konstante Wachstumsgeschwindigkeit auf, wenn man dieselbe genau auf Reihenröntgenbildern ausmisst. Der Einfluss von ionisierenden Strahlen auf die Metastasen kann klar bestimmt werden. Fraktionierte Bestrahlung führte zu einer konzentrischen Verkleinerung des Umfangs der Matastasen, deren Grenzen aber bemerkenswert klar definiert bleiben. Diese Feststellung ermöglicht es den Prozenentsatz der Volumenabnahme durch die Bestimmung des Durchmessers der Matastasen zu errechnen. Der Autor verfügt über genügende Einzelheiten über 16 Patienten, um eine quantitative Analyse zu ermöglichen. Er fand dass wenige Tage nach der ersten Strahlendosis eine Volumenabnahme bemerkt wird. Die Wiederholung derselben täglichen Dosis erzeugte einen Prozentsatz der Abnahme, welche zu einer exponentiellen Ueberlebenskurve führte. Sobald die letzte Dosis einer Serie verabfolgt worden war, begann sofort oder innerhalb weniger Tage ein neues Tumorenwachstum und zwar mit der selben Geschwindigkeit wie vor der Behandlung. Die Ueberlebenszeiten stimmen mit der von Elkind ausgearbeiteten exponentiellen Kurve für fraktionierte Bestrahlungen von Gewebskulturen überein. Auf diese Weise konnte die mittlere letale Dosis D37, welche als die Dosis, die 37 Prozent des ursprünglichen Volumens mit erhaltener Wachstumsfähigkeit übcrleben lässt, definiert wird, errechnet werden unter Verabreichung von 100–150 rad pro Tag durch Anwendung entweder von 250 kV-Röntgenstrahlen oder von Kobalt-60. Die Resultate ergaben grosse Unterschiede der Strahlenemfindlichkeit der verschiedenen Tumortypen. Werte für die D37 von 300 bis zu 2550 rad wurden gefunden. Diese Unterschiede, die einem Faktor von 8,5 entsprechen, können nicht durch die Annahme, dass alle Zellen dieselbe Strahlenempfindlichkeit haben, erklärt werden und ebensowenig durch die Hypothese, dass alle Unterschiede auf Differenzen in der Sauerstoffspannung innerhalb der Gewebe beruhen. Gute Uebereinstimmungen wurden gefunden, zwischen der Strahlenemfindlichkeit (D37) und der Wachstumsgeschwindigkeit gemessen an der Verdopplungszeit (T2). Für alle Fälle entspsircht die Gleichung log D37 = 1,780 + 0,652 log T2 ziemlich genau den Beohachtungen. Wenn man zwei Tumofen mit langsamer Wachstumsgeschwindigkeit (T2 {$>$} 150 Tage) aus der Aufstellung der D37 fallen lässt, stimmen alle Werte für D37 mit der lineären Korrelation laut der Gleichung D37 = 220 + 10 T2 überein. Der Verfasser bespricht die möglichen Erklärungen seiner Befunde im Lichte der modernen experimentellen Radiobiologie. Die Wichtigkeit derselben für die klinische Radiobiologie und für die radiotherapeutische Praxis wird ebenfalls erwähnt. Die Möglichkeit, die letale Dosis für einen Tumor, wenn dessen Volumen und Wachstumsgeschwindigkeit bekannt sind, zu errechnen, erscheint ihm von besonderem Interesse zu sein. Selbstverständlich sind noch weitere Forschungen auf verschiedenen Gebieten notwendig, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen.},

Staining correlates with absolute protein levels and has been investigated as a clinical tool for patient diagnosis and prognosis. For these reasons, automated imaging methods have been developed in an attempt to standardize IHC analysis. We propose a novel imaging technique in which brightfield images of diaminobenzidene (DAB)-labeled antigens are converted to normalized blue images, allowing automated identification of positively stained tissue. A statistical analysis compared our method with seven previously published imaging techniques by measuring each one's agreement with manual analysis by two observers. Eighteen DAB-stained images showing a range of protein levels were used. Accuracy was assessed by calculating the percentage of pixels misclassified using each technique compared with a manual standard. Bland-Altman analysis was then used to show the extent to which misclassification affected staining quantification. Many of the techniques were inconsistent in classifying DAB staining due to background interference, but our method was statistically the most accurate and consistent across all staining levels.}

METHODS: Patients who  underwent pneumonectomy for clinical stage IIIA NSCLC were abstracted from the  National Cancer Database. Individuals treated with neoadjuvant therapy, followed by  resection, were compared with those who underwent resection, followed by adjuvant  therapy. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with  30-day mortality. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to identify factors  associated with survival. RESULTS: Pneumonectomy for stage IIIA NSCLC with R0  resection was performed in 1,033 patients; of these, 739 (71\%) received neoadjuvant  therapy, and 294 (29\%) underwent resection, followed by adjuvant therapy. The two  groups were well matched for age, gender, race, income, Charlson comorbidity score,  and tumor size. The 30-day mortality rate in the neoadjuvant group was 7.8\% (57 of  739). Median survival was similar between the two groups: 25.9 months neoadjuvant vs  31.3 months adjuvant (p~= 0.74). A multivariable logistic regression model for  30-day mortality demonstrated that increasing age, annual income of less than  \$35,000, nonacademic facility, and right-sided resection were associated with~an  elevated risk of 30-day mortality. A multivariable Cox model for survival  demonstrated that increasing age was predictive of shorter survival and that  administration of neoadjuvant therapy did not confer a~survival advantage over  adjuvant therapy (p~=~0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who require pneumonectomy  for clinical stage IIIA NSCLC receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, without an  improvement in survival. In these patients, primary resection, followed by adjuvant  chemoradiotherapy, may provide equivalent long-term outcomes.},

The subject was divided into different topics, which were then assigned to at least two experts. The authors searched the literature according to their own strategies, with no central literature review being performed. The draft reports written by the experts on each topic were reviewed, discussed and voted on by the entire expert panel. The evidence supporting each recommendation was summarised, and graded as described by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Grading Review Group. Clinical practice guidelines were generated and finalised in a functional algorithm for risk stratification of the lung resection candidates, emphasising cardiological evaluation, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, systematic carbon monoxide lung diffusion capacity and exercise testing. Contrary to lung resection, for which the scientific evidences are more robust, we were unable to recommend any specific test, cut-off value, or algorithm before chemo-radiotherapy due to the lack of data. We recommend that lung cancer patients should be managed in specialised settings by multidisciplinary teams.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) has been proposed as a tool for cardiac risk stratification before lung resection. However, the RCRI was originally developed from a generic surgical population including a small group of thoracic patients. The objective of this study was to recalibrate the RCRI in candidates for major lung resections to provide a more specific instrument for cardiac risk stratification. METHODS: One thousand six hundred ninety-six patients who underwent lobectomy (1,426) or pneumonectomy (270) in two centers between the years of 2000 and 2008 were analyzed. Stepwise logistic regression and bootstrap analyses were used to recalibrate the six variables comprising the RCRI. The outcome variable was occurrence of major cardiac complications (cardiac arrest, complete heart block, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or cardiac death during admission). Only those variables with a probability of less than 0.1 in more than 50\% of bootstrap samples were retained in the final model and proportionally weighted according to their regression estimates. RESULTS: The incidence of major cardiac morbidity was 3.3\% (57 patients). Four of the six variables present in the RCRI were reliably associated with major cardiac complications: cerebrovascular disease (1.5 points), cardiac ischemia (1.5 points), renal disease (1 point), and pneumonectomy (1.5 points). Patients were grouped into four classes according to their recalibrated RCRI, predicting an incremental risk of cardiac morbidity (p {$<$} 0.0001). Compared with the traditional RCRI, the recalibrated score had a higher discrimination (c indexes, 0.72 versus 0.62; p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The recalibrated RCRI can be reliably used as a first-line screening instrument during cardiologic risk stratification for selecting those patients needing further cardiologic testing from those who can proceed with pulmonary evaluation without any further cardiac tests.},

We prove strong identifiability results given unknown single-node interventions, i.e., without having access to the intervention targets. This generalizes prior works which have focused on weaker classes, such as linear maps or paired counterfactual data. This is also the first instance of causal identifiability from non-paired interventions for deep neural network embeddings. Our proof relies on carefully uncovering the high-dimensional geometric structure present in the data distribution after a non-linear density transformation, which we capture by analyzing quadratic forms of precision matrices of the latent distributions. Finally, we propose a contrastive algorithm to identify the latent variables in practice and evaluate its performance on various tasks.},

Clinical and laboratory parameters of  patients at first presentation were recorded, and patients were divided into two  groups according to the presence of AO in thorax computed tomography (CT). Survival  was calculated using Kaplan-Meier and univariate Cox's regression analyses.  Laboratory parameters that might be related with prolonged survival in atelectasis  were compared using chi-square, Student's t, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of the  patients, 54\% had stage IV disease, and AO was detected in 48.3\% of all cases.  Overall median survival was 13.2 months for all cases, 10.9 months for patients  without AO, and 13.9 months for patients with AO (P=0.067). Survival was  significantly longer in stage III patients with AO (14.5 months versus 9.2 months,  P=0.032), but not in stage IV patients. Patients with AO in stage III had  significantly lower platelet counts (P=0.032) and blood sedimentation rates than did  those with no AO (P=0.045). We concluded that atelectasis and/or obstructive  pneumonitis was associated with prolonged survival in locally advanced NSCLC.

However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge—the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers—to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted κ, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.840–0.884) and 0.868 (95\% CI, 0.835–0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials.},

The degree of attenuation differs in the whole population and in a case–control sample, and the property of invariance to outcome-dependent sampling is only true for the IOR. The relevance of the non collapsibility of odds ratios in a range of methodological areas is discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The TNM staging system originated as a response to the need for an accurate, consistent, universal cancer outcome prediction system. Since the TNM staging system was introduced in the 1950s, new prognostic factors have been identified and new methods for integrating prognostic factors have been developed. This study compares the prediction accuracy of the TNM staging system with that of artificial neural network statistical models. METHODS For 5-year survival of patients with breast or colorectal carcinoma, the authors compared the TNM staging system's predictive accuracy with that of artificial neural networks (ANN). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as applied to an independent validation data set, was the measure of accuracy. RESULTS For the American College of Surgeons' Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) data set, using only the TNM variables (tumor size, number of positive regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis), the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with breast carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.720; ANN, 0.770; P {$<$} 0.001). For the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results breast carcinoma data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of 10-year survival were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.692; ANN, 0.730; P {$<$} 0.01). For the PCE colorectal data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with colorectal carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.737; ANN, 0.815; P {$<$} 0.001). Adding commonly collected demographic and anatomic variables to the TNM variables further increased the accuracy of the artificial neural network's predictions of breast carcinoma survival (0.784) and colorectal carcinoma survival (0.869). CONCLUSIONS Artificial neural networks are significantly more accurate than the TNM staging system when both use the TNM prognostic factors alone. New prognostic factors can be added to artificial neural networks to increase prognostic accuracy further. These results are robust across different data sets and cancer sites.

  abstract = {We introduce a general, flexible, parametric survival modelling framework which encompasses key shapes of hazard function (constant, increasing, decreasing, up-then-down, down-then-up), various common survival distributions (log-logistic, Burr type XII, Weibull, Gompertz), and includes defective distributions (cure models). This generality is achieved using four distributional parameters: two scale-type parameters – which, respectively, relate to accelerated failure time (AFT) and proportional hazards (PH) modelling – and two shape parameters. Furthermore, we advocate “multi-parameter regression” whereby more than one distributional parameter depends on covariates – rather than the usual convention of having a single covariate-dependent (scale) parameter. This general formulation unifies the most popular survival models, allowing us to consider the practical value of possible modelling choices. In particular, we suggest introducing covariates through just one or other of the two scale parameters (covering AFT and PH models), and through a “power” shape parameter (covering more complex non-AFT/non-PH effects); the other shape parameter remains covariate-independent, and handles automatic selection of the baseline distribution. We explore inferential issues and compare with alternative models through various simulation studies, with particular focus on evidence concerning the need, or otherwise, to include both AFT and PH parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of our modelling framework using data from lung cancer, melanoma, and kidney function studies. Censoring is accommodated throughout.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Advanced MR imaging techniques are critical to understanding the pathophysiology of conditions involving the spinal cord. We provide a novel, quantitative solution to map vertebral and spinal cord levels accounting for anatomic variability within the human spinal cord. For the first time, we report a population distribution of the segmental anatomy of the cervical spinal cord that has direct implications for the interpretation of advanced imaging studies most often conducted across groups of subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent a T2-weighted, 3T MRI of the cervical spinal cord. Two experts marked the C3–C8 cervical nerve rootlets, C3–C7 vertebral bodies, and pontomedullary junction. A semiautomated algorithm was used to locate the centerline of the spinal cord and measure rostral-caudal distances from a fixed point in the brain stem, the pontomedullary junction, to each of the spinal rootlets and vertebral bodies. Distances to each location were compared across subjects. Six volunteers had 2 additional scans in neck flexion and extension to measure the effects of patient positioning in the scanner. RESULTS: We demonstrated that substantial variation exists in the rostral-caudal position of spinal cord segments among individuals and that prior methods of predicting spinal segments are imprecise. We also show that neck flexion or extension has little effect on the relative location of vertebral-versus-spinal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for spinal level variation is lacking in existing imaging studies. Future studies should account for this variation for accurate interpretation of the neuroanatomic origin of acquired MR signals.},

We investigated the effects of age, race, sex, smoking status, and history of disease on the relation between body-mass index and mortality. METHODS: In a prospective study of more than 1 million adults in the United States (457,785 men and 588,369 women), 201,622 deaths occurred during 14 years of follow-up. We examined the relation between body-mass index and the risk of death from all causes in four subgroups categorized according to smoking status and history of disease. In healthy people who had never smoked, we further examined whether the relation varied according to race, cause of death, or age. The relative risk was used to assess the relation between mortality and body-mass index. RESULTS: The association between body-mass index and the risk of death was substantially modified by smoking status and the presence of disease. In healthy people who had never smoked, the nadir of the curve for body-mass index and mortality was found at a body-mass index of 23.5 to 24.9 in men and 22.0 to 23.4 in women. Among subjects with the highest body-mass indexes, white men and women had a relative risk of death of 2.58 and 2.00, respectively, as compared with those with a body-mass index of 23.5 to 24.9. Black men and women with the highest body-mass indexes had much lower risks of death (1.35 and 1.21), which did not differ significantly from 1.00. A high body-mass index was most predictive of death from cardiovascular disease, especially in men (relative risk, 2.90; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.37 to 3.56). Heavier men and women in all age groups had an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other diseases increases throughout the range of moderate and severe overweight for both men and women in all age groups. The risk associated with a high body-mass index is greater for whites than for blacks.},

In standard uncertainty quantification (UQ), AI uncertainty is calibrated such that the confidence of its predictions matches the statistics of the underlying data distribution. However, this method of calibration does not take into consideration the direct influence of UQ on the subsequent actions taken by downstream decision-makers. Here we demonstrate an alternate, decision-driven method of UQ calibration that explicitly minimizes the incurred costs of downstream decisions. After formulating decision-driven calibration as an optimization problem with respect to a known decision-maker, we show in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario how decision-driven temperature scaling can lead to lower incurred decision costs.},

  abstract = {Background: PREDICT is a breast cancer prognostic and treatment benefit model implemented online. The overall fit of the model has been good in multiple independent case series, but PREDICT has been shown to underestimate breast cancer specific mortality in women diagnosed under the age of 40. Another limitation is the use of discrete categories for tumour size and node status resulting in ‘step’ changes in risk estimates on moving between categories. We have refitted the PREDICT prognostic model using the original cohort of cases from East Anglia with updated survival time in order to take into account age at diagnosis and to smooth out the survival function for tumour size and node status. Methods: Multivariable Cox regression models were used to fit separate models for ER negative and ER positive disease. Continuous variables were fitted using fractional polynomials and a smoothed baseline hazard was obtained by regressing the baseline cumulative hazard for each patients against time using fractional polynomials. The fit of the prognostic models were then tested in three independent data sets that had also been used to validate the original version of PREDICT. Results: In the model fitting data, after adjusting for other prognostic variables, there is an increase in risk of breast cancer specific mortality in younger and older patients with ER positive disease, with a substantial increase in risk for women diagnosed before the age of 35. In ER negative disease the risk increases slightly with age. The association between breast cancer specific mortality and both tumour size and number of positive nodes was non-linear with a more marked increase in risk with increasing size and increasing number of nodes in ER positive disease. The overall calibration and discrimination of the new version of PREDICT (v2) was good and comparable to that of the previous version in both model development and validation data sets. However, the calibration of v2 improved over v1 in patients diagnosed under the age of 40. Conclusions: The PREDICT v2 is an improved prognostication and treatment benefit model compared with v1. The online version should continue to aid clinical decision making in women with early breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Background: Gefitinib is a selective inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is overexpressed in many cancers, including non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We carried out a clinical study to compare the relationship between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR protein expression, EGFR mutations, and Akt activation status as predictive markers for gefitinib therapy in advanced NSCLC. Methods: Tumors from 102 NSCLC patients treated daily with 250 mg of gefitinib were evaluated for EGFR status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), DNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry and for Akt activation status (phospho-Akt [P-Akt]) by immunohistochemistry. Time to progression, overall survival, and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and evaluated by the Kaplan–Meier method; groups were compared using the log-rank test. Risk factors associated with survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling and multivariable analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Amplification or high polysomy of the EGFR gene (seen in 33 of 102 patients) and high protein expression (seen in 58 of 98 patients) were statistically significantly associated with better response (36\% versus 3\%, mean difference = 34\%, 95\% CI = 16.6 to 50.3; P \&lt;.001), disease control rate (67\% versus 26\%, mean difference = 40.6\%, 95\% CI = 21.5 to 59.7; P \&lt;.001), time to progression (9.0 versus 2.5 months, mean difference = 6.5 months, 95\% CI = 2.8 to 10.3; P \&lt;.001), and survival (18.7 versus 7.0 months, mean difference = 11.7 months, 95\% CI = 2.1 to 21.4; P = .03). EGFR mutations (seen in 15 of 89 patients) were also statistically significantly related to response and time to progression, but the association with survival was not statistically significant, and 40\% of the patients with mutation had progressive disease. In multivariable analysis, only high EGFR gene copy number remained statistically significantly associated with better survival (hazard ratio = 0.44, 95\% CI = 0.23 to 0.82). Independent of EGFR assessment method, EGFR + /P-Akt + patients had a statistically significantly better outcome than EGFR − , P-Akt − , or EGFR + /P-Akt − patients. Conclusions: High EGFR gene copy number identified by FISH may be an effective molecular predictor for gefitinib efficacy in advanced NSCLC.}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are recommended for the first-line treatment of most patients with well-differentiated, gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors; however, benefit from treatment is heterogeneous. The aim of the current study was to develop and validate a progression-free survival (PFS) prediction model in SSA-treated patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We extracted data from the Spanish Group of Neuroendocrine and Endocrine Tumors Registry (R-GETNE). Patient eligibility criteria included GEP primary, Ki-67 of 20\% or less, and first-line SSA monotherapy for advanced disease. An accelerated failure time model was developed to predict PFS, which was represented as a nomogram and an online calculator. The nomogram was externally validated in an independent series of consecutive eligible patients (The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom). RESULTS: We recruited 535 patients (R-GETNE, n = 438; Manchester, n = 97). Median PFS and overall survival in the derivation cohort were 28.7 (95\% CI, 23.8 to 31.1) and 85.9 months (95\% CI, 71.5 to 96.7 months), respectively. Nine covariates significantly associated with PFS were primary tumor location, Ki-67 percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, alkaline phosphatase, extent of liver involvement, presence of bone and peritoneal metastases, documented progression status, and the presence of symptoms when initiating SSA. The GETNE-TRASGU (Treated With Analog of Somatostatin in Gastroenteropancreatic and Unknown Primary NETs) model demonstrated suitable calibration, as well as fair discrimination ability with a C-index value of 0.714 (95\% CI, 0.680 to 0.747) and 0.732 (95\% CI, 0.658 to 0.806) in the derivation and validation series, respectively. CONCLUSION: The GETNE-TRASGU evidence-based prognostic tool stratifies patients with GEP neuroendocrine tumors receiving SSA treatment according to their estimated PFS. This nomogram may be useful when stratifying patients with neuroendocrine tumors in future trials. Furthermore, it could be a valuable tool for making treatment decisions in daily clinical practice.},

Average final exam scores among students assigned to classrooms that allowed computers were 0.18 standard deviations lower than exam scores of students in classrooms that prohibited computers. Through the use of two separate treatment arms, we uncover evidence that this negative effect occurs in classrooms where laptops and tablets are permitted without restriction and in classrooms where students are only permitted to use tablets that must remain flat on the desk.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Owing to the expected poor long-term outcomes and high postoperative morbidity and mortality, patients with stage IIIA-N2 tumors candidate to  pneumonectomy (PN) are usually excluded from surgery. This study aims to analyze the  outcome of patients who underwent PN to prove its safety and feasibility. PATIENTS  AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 233 patients who underwent PN for  N2 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 1998 and 2015. Eighty-five patients  were occult N2 disease (group 1), whereas 148 patients underwent induction therapy  (IT) for stage IIIA-N2 (group 2). RESULTS: Overall morbidity, postoperative  mortality, and 90-day mortality rates were 46.8\%, 2.6\%, and 8.6\%, respectively. The  2 groups (group 1 vs. 2) had similar postoperative and 90-day mortality rates: 2.4\%  versus 2.7\% (P~= 1.00), and 9.4\% versus 8.1\% (P~= .81), respectively. The incidence  of major morbidity was higher and statistically significant in group 2 compared with  group 1: 23\% versus 12.9\% (P~=~.1). Postoperative bronchopleural fistula occurred in  4.7\% (4/85) of patients with occult N2 (group 1) and in 10.1\% (15/148) of patients  undergoing IT (group 2) (P~= .10). Median overall survival (OS) was 2.2 years, with  a 3 and 5-year OS of 43.4\% and 31.6\%, respectively. Disease-free survival (DFS) was  1.5 years, with 3 and 5-year DFS of 41.6\% and 32\%, respectively; no difference in OS  and DFS between the 2 groups was found. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the acceptable  morbidity and mortality rate and the long-term survival, PN should not be excluded  for selected patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC as a matter of principle.},

  abstract = {This article discusses how the language of causality can shed new light on the major challenges in machine learning for medical imaging: 1) data scarcity, which is the limited availability of high-quality annotations, and 2) data mismatch, whereby a trained algorithm may fail to generalize in clinical practice. Looking at these challenges through the lens of causality allows decisions about data collection, annotation procedures, and learning strategies to be made (and scrutinized) more transparently. We discuss how causal relationships between images and annotations can not only have profound effects on the performance of predictive models, but may even dictate which learning strategies should be considered in the first place. For example, we conclude that semi-supervision may be unsuitable for image segmentation---one of the possibly surprising insights from our causal analysis, which is illustrated with representative real-world examples of computer-aided diagnosis (skin lesion classification in dermatology) and radiotherapy (automated contouring of tumours). We highlight that being aware of and accounting for the causal relationships in medical imaging data is important for the safe development of machine learning and essential for regulation and responsible reporting. To facilitate this we provide step-by-step recommendations for future studies.},

Furthermore, we introduce cross-calibration, a data-efficient variant of calibration that eliminates the need for hold-out calibration sets. Cross-calibration leverages cross-fitted predictors and generates a single calibrated predictor using all available data. Under weak conditions that do not assume monotonicity, we establish that both causal isotonic calibration and cross-calibration achieve fast doubly-robust calibration rates, as long as either the propensity score or outcome regression is estimated accurately in a suitable sense. The proposed causal isotonic calibrator can be wrapped around any black-box learning algorithm, providing robust and distribution-free calibration guarantees while preserving predictive performance.},

  abstract = {Background While artificial intelligence (AI) offers possibilities of advanced clinical prediction and decision-making in healthcare, models trained on relatively homogeneous datasets, and populations poorly-representative of underlying diversity, limits generalisability and risks biased AI-based decisions. Here, we describe the landscape of AI in clinical medicine to delineate population and data-source disparities. Methods We performed a scoping review of clinical papers published in PubMed in 2019 using AI techniques. We assessed differences in dataset country source, clinical specialty, and author nationality, sex, and expertise. A manually tagged subsample of PubMed articles was used to train a model, leveraging transfer-learning techniques (building upon an existing BioBERT model) to predict eligibility for inclusion (original, human, clinical AI literature). Of all eligible articles, database country source and clinical specialty were manually labelled. A BioBERT-based model predicted first/last author expertise. Author nationality was determined using corresponding affiliated institution information using Entrez Direct. And first/last author sex was evaluated using the Gendarize.io API. Results Our search yielded 30,576 articles, of which 7,314 (23.9\%) were eligible for further analysis. Most databases came from the US (40.8\%) and China (13.7\%). Radiology was the most represented clinical specialty (40.4\%), followed by pathology (9.1\%). Authors were primarily from either China (24.0\%) or the US (18.4\%). First and last authors were predominately data experts (i.e., statisticians) (59.6\% and 53.9\% respectively) rather than clinicians. And the majority of first/last authors were male (74.1\%). Interpretation U.S. and Chinese datasets and authors were disproportionately overrepresented in clinical AI, and almost all of the top 10 databases and author nationalities were from high income countries (HICs). AI techniques were most commonly employed for image-rich specialties, and authors were predominantly male, with non-clinical backgrounds. Development of technological infrastructure in data-poor regions, and diligence in external validation and model re-calibration prior to clinical implementation in the short-term, are crucial in ensuring clinical AI is meaningful for broader populations, and to avoid perpetuating global health inequity.},

All patients received short‐term intensive regimens (cyclophosphamide, etoposide and methotrexate or ifosfamide and etoposide, both followed by thoracic irradiation if complete response was noted). Lactate dehydrogenase (               p               = 0.0001), tumour stage (               p               = 0.0001), serum sodium (               p               = 0.0009), pretreatment Karnofsky performance score (               p               = 0.0121), alkaline phosphatase (               p               = 0.0186) and serum bicarbonate (               p               = 0.0321) were the important prognostic factors. Once these variables were taken into account no other variable provided additional prognostic information. A simple scoring system (“Manchester Score”) using these variables was established and shows little loss of information compared to the Cox analysis. The score distinguishes 3 prognostic groups, the best of which contains all long‐term survivors, whereas the bad prognostic group contains no patient surviving longer than one year. The scoring system may help to design new treatment strategies and may also facilitate the comparison of different studies.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Bevacizumab improves survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase II clinical trial assessed the effects of the  addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable nonsquamous NSCLC.  METHODS: Patients with resectable stage IB-IIIA nonsquamous NSCLC were treated with  bevacizumab followed by imaging 2 weeks later to assess single-agent effect. After  this they received two cycles of bevacizumab with four cycles of cisplatin and  docetaxel followed by surgical resection. Resected patients were eligible for  adjuvant bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathological downstaging  (decrease from pretreatment clinical stage to post-treatment pathological stage).  Secondary endpoints included overall survival, safety, and radiologic response.  RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Thirty-four (68\%) were clinical stage IIIA.  All three doses of neoadjuvant bevacizumab were delivered to 40 of 50 patients. Six  patients (12\%) discontinued because of bevacizumab-related adverse events. The rate  of downstaging (38\%), response to chemotherapy (45\%), and perioperative  complications (12\%) were comparable with historical data. No partial responses were  observed to single-agent bevacizumab, but 18\% of the patients developed new  intratumoral cavitation, with a trend toward improved pathologic response (57\%  versus 21\%; p = 0.07). A major pathologic response (≥90\% treatment effect) was  associated with survival at 3 years (100\% versus 49\%; p = 0.01). No patients with  KRAS-mutant NSCLC (0 of 10) had a pathologic response as compared with 11 of 31 with  wild-type KRAS. CONCLUSION: Although preoperative bevacizumab plus chemotherapy was  feasible, it did not improve downstaging in unselected patients. New cavitation  after single-agent bevacizumab is a potential biomarker. Alternative strategies are  needed for KRAS-mutant tumors.},

An understanding of the physiologic role and relative contribution of the three NO synthase isoforms (neuronal—NOS1, inducible—NOS2, and endothelial—NOS3) is imperative to comprehend derangements of the NO signaling pathway in the failing cardiovascular system. Several theories of NO and its regulation have developed as explanations for the divergent observations from studies in health and disease states. Here we review the physiologic and pathophysiologic influence of NO on cardiac function, in a framework that considers several theories of altered NO signaling in heart failure. We discuss the notion of spatial compartmentalization of NO signaling within the myocyte in an effort to reconcile many controversies about derangements in the influences of NO in the heart and vasculature.},

OBJECTIVE: To report the final (5-year)  results of a prospective study evaluating concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose PBT  to treat unresectable stage III NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this  open-label, single-group assignment study, with median follow-up of 27.3 months for  all patients and 79.6 months for survivors, 64 patients were enrolled and analyzed;  inclusion criteria were unresectable IIIA/IIIB histologically confirmed NSCLC,  Karnofsky performance status 70 to 100, and 6-month prediagnosis weight loss of no  more than 10\%. Staging used positron emission tomography and/or computed tomography.  Induction chemotherapy was allowed. INTERVENTIONS: Concurrent chemotherapy  (carboplatin-paclitaxel) and passively scattered PBT (74-Gy relative biological  effectiveness) in all patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Kaplan-Meier analysis of  overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), actuarial distant  metastasis, and locoregional recurrence. Patterns of treatment failure were  categorized as local/regional or distant. Acute and late toxic effects were  prospectively assigned using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v3.0.  RESULTS: Of 64 patients (22 [34\%] female; median [range] age, 70 [37-78] years;  stage IIIA, 30 [47\%]; IIIB, 34 [53\%]), 17 (27\%) were alive at last follow-up. Median  OS was 26.5 months (5-year OS, 29\%; 95\% CI, 18\%-41\%). Five-year PFS was 22\% (95\% CI,  12\%-32\%); 5-year actuarial distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence were 54\%  (n\,=\,36) and 28\% (n\,=\,22), respectively. Treatment failures were largely (31 [48\%]  patients) distant, with low rates of crude local (10 [16\%]) and regional (9 [14\%])  recurrences. Rates of grade 2 and 3 acute esophagitis were 18 (28\%) and 5 (8\%),  respectively. Acute grade 2 pneumonitis occurred in 1 (2\%) patient. Late toxic  effects were uncommon: 1 (2\%) patient developed an esophageal stricture (grade 2)  and 1 (2\%) grade 4 esophagitis. Late grades 2 and 3 pneumonitis occurred in 10 (16\%)  and 8 (12\%), respectively. Two (3\%) patients developed a bronchial stricture (grade  2), and 1 (2\%) a grade 4 bronchial fistula. There were no acute or late grade 5  toxic effects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Concurrent chemotherapy and PBT to treat  unresectable NSCLC afford promising clinical outcomes and rates of toxic effects  compared with historical photon therapy data. Further optimization of proton  therapy, particularly intensity-modulated proton therapy, is still needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The standard of care for operable, stage I, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for inoperable stage I NSCLC has shown promising results, but two independent, randomised, phase 3 trials of SABR in patients with operable stage I NSCLC (STARS and ROSEL) closed early due to slow accrual. We aimed to assess overall survival for SABR versus surgery by pooling data from these trials. METHODS: Eligible patients in the STARS and ROSEL studies were those with clinical T1-2a ({$<$}4 cm), N0M0, operable NSCLC. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to SABR or lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection or sampling. We did a pooled analysis in the intention-to-treat population using overall survival as the primary endpoint. Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (STARS: NCT00840749; ROSEL: NCT00687986). FINDINGS: 58 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (31 to SABR and 27 to surgery). Median follow-up was 40·2 months (IQR 23·0-47·3) for the SABR group and 35·4 months (18·9-40·7) for the surgery group. Six patients in the surgery group died compared with one patient in the SABR group. Estimated overall survival at 3 years was 95\% (95\% CI 85-100) in the SABR group compared with 79\% (64-97) in the surgery group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·14 [95\% CI 0·017-1·190], log-rank p=0·037). Recurrence-free survival at 3 years was 86\% (95\% CI 74-100) in the SABR group and 80\% (65-97) in the surgery group (HR 0·69 [95\% CI 0·21-2·29], log-rank p=0·54). In the surgery group, one patient had regional nodal recurrence and two had distant metastases; in the SABR group, one patient had local recurrence, four had regional nodal recurrence, and one had distant metastases. Three (10\%) patients in the SABR group had grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (three [10\%] chest wall pain, two [6\%] dyspnoea or cough, and one [3\%] fatigue and rib fracture). No patients given SABR had grade 4 events or treatment-related death. In the surgery group, one (4\%) patient died of surgical complications and 12 (44\%) patients had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. Grade 3 events occurring in more than one patient in the surgery group were dyspnoea (four [15\%] patients), chest pain (four [15\%] patients), and lung infections (two [7\%]). INTERPRETATION: SABR could be an option for treating operable stage I NSCLC. Because of the small patient sample size and short follow-up, additional randomised studies comparing SABR with surgery in operable patients are warranted.

  abstract = {Background A previous pooled analysis of the STARS and ROSEL trials showed higher survival after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) than with surgery for operable early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but that analysis had notable limitations. This study reports long-term results of the revised STARS trial, in which the SABR group was re-accrued with a larger sample size, along with a protocol-specified propensity-matched comparison with a prospectively registered, contemporary institutional cohort of patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection (VATS L-MLND). Methods This single-arm prospective trial was done at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with a Zubrod performance status of 0–2, newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed NSCLC with N0M0 disease (squamous cell, adenocarcinoma, large cell, or NSCLC not otherwise specified), and a tumour diameter of 3 cm or less. This trial did not include patients from the previous pooled analysis. SABR dosing was 54 Gy in three fractions (for peripheral lesions) or 50 Gy in four fractions (for central tumours; simultaneous integrated boost to gross tumour totalling 60 Gy). The primary endpoint was the 3-year overall survival. For the propensity-matching analysis, we used a surgical cohort from the MD Anderson Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery's prospectively registered, institutional review board-approved database of all patients with clinical stage I NSCLC who underwent VATS L-MLND during the period of enrolment in this trial. Non-inferiority could be claimed if the 3-year overall survival rate after SABR was lower than that after VATS L-MLND by 12\% or less and the upper bound of the 95\% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) was less than 1·965. Propensity matching consisted of determining a propensity score using a multivariable logistic regression model including several covariates (age, tumour size, histology, performance status, and the interaction of age and sex); based on the propensity scores, one patient in the SABR group was randomly matched with one patient in the VATS L-MLND group using a 5:1 digit greedy match algorithm. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02357992. Findings Between Sept 1, 2015, and Jan 31, 2017, 80 patients were enrolled and included in efficacy and safety analyses. Median follow-up time was 5·1 years (IQR 3·9–5·8). Overall survival was 91\% (95\% CI 85–98) at 3 years and 87\% (79–95) at 5 years. SABR was tolerated well, with no grade 4–5 toxicity and one (1\%) case each of grade 3 dyspnoea, grade 2 pneumonitis, and grade 2 lung fibrosis. No serious adverse events were recorded. Overall survival in the propensity-matched VATS L-MLND cohort was 91\% (95\% CI 85–98) at 3 years and 84\% (76–93) at 5 years. Non-inferiority was claimed since the 3-year overall survival after SABR was not lower than that observed in the VATS L-MLND group. There was no significant difference in overall survival between the two patient cohorts (hazard ratio 0·86 [95\% CI 0·45–1·65], p=0·65) from a multivariable analysis. Interpretation Long-term survival after SABR is non-inferior to VATS L-MLND for operable stage IA NSCLC. SABR remains promising for such cases but multidisciplinary management is strongly recommended. Funding Varian Medical Systems and US National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health).},

Experiences from different groups have demonstrated Google Glass' potential in improving perioperative care, intraoperative communication and documentation, surgical outcome as well as surgical training. On the other hand, the device has technical limitations, notably suboptimal image qualities and a short battery life. Its operational functions also bring forth concerns on the protection of patient privacy. Nonetheless, the technological advances that this device embodies hold promises in surgical innovations.

  abstract = {Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill this gap, we present a deep learning (DL)–based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We built the DL-based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients' data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL-based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P = 7.13e−6) and good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) = 0.68]. More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19 and EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n = 230, C-index = 0.75), NCI cohort (n = 221, C-index = 0.67), Chinese cohort (n = 166, C-index = 0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n = 40, C-index = 0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n = 27, C-index = 0.82). This is the first study to employ DL to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of patients with HCC. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction. Clin Cancer Res; 24(6); 1248–59. ©2017 AACR.},

  abstract = {Objective To assist clinicians in arranging personalized treatment, planning follow-up programs and extending survival times for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, a method of deep learning combined with computed tomography (CT) imaging for survival prediction was designed. Methods Data were collected from 484 patients from four research centers. The data from 344 patients were utilized to build the A\_CNN survival prognosis model to classify 2-year overall survival time ranges (730 days cut-off). Data from 140 patients, including independent internal and external test sets, were utilized for model testing. First, a series of preprocessing techniques were used to process the original CT images and generate training and test data sets from the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Second, the structure of the A\_CNN model was designed based on asymmetric convolution, bottleneck blocks, the uniform cross-entropy (UC) loss function, and other advanced techniques. After that, the A\_CNN model was trained, and numerous comparative experiments were designed to obtain the best prognostic survival model. Last, the model performance was evaluated, and the predicted survival curves were analyzed. Results The A\_CNN survival prognosis model yielded a high patient-level accuracy of 88.8\%, a patch-level accuracy of 82.9\%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.932. When tested on an external data set, the maximum patient-level accuracy was 80.0\%. Conclusions The results suggest that using a deep learning method can improve prognosis in patients with NSCLC and has important application value in establishing individualized prognostic models.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury occurs frequently in patients subsequent to coronary artery revascularization or myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (MIR). Hypotension and excessive nitric oxide (NO) production through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were implicated in renal injury. On the other hand, NO may have a protective role during early reperfusion. In this study, we aim to compare protective effectiveness of 1400W, a highly selective iNOS inhibitor, and L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a non-specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, against MIR-induced hemodynamic stabilization and kidney injury. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were evenly divided in four groups including sham-operated, MIR, and groups pretreated with 1400W (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, [ip]) or L-NAME (30 mg/kg, ip) 15 minutes before MIR. Ischemia was conducted by occluding the left coronary artery for 30 minutes, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. We determined the measured aortic pressure (MAP) and assessed kidney injury through serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), methylguanidine (MG), malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO at different phases during the study. RESULTS: MAP, decreased during myocardial ischemia, increased during early reperfusion; however, that was abolished with L-NAME pretreatment, and the increase was moderate with 1400W pretreatment. Serum MDA, MG and BUN levels, although relatively unaltered during ischemia, significantly increased after 120 minutes of reperfusion. Treatment with 1400W reduced post-reperfusion MDA and MG levels (P~{$<$} .05), but the improvement was not significant with L-NAME. CONCLUSIONS: 1400W was effective in reducing MIR-induced hemodynamic instability and kidney injury, in contrast to no apparent protection with L-NAME administration.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used as decision-support tools in high-risk domains. Evaluating the causal impact of deploying such models can be done with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that randomizes users to ML vs. control groups and assesses the effect on relevant outcomes. However, ML models are inevitably updated over time, and we often lack evidence for the causal impact of these updates. While the causal effect could be repeatedly validated with ongoing RCTs, such experiments are expensive and time-consuming to run. In this work, we present an alternative solution: using only data from a prior RCT, we give conditions under which the causal impact of a new ML model can be precisely bounded or estimated, even if it was not included in the RCT. Our assumptions incorporate two realistic constraints: ML predictions are often deterministic, and their impacts depend on user trust in the model. Based on our analysis, we give recommendations for trial designs that maximize our ability to assess future versions of an ML model. Our hope is that our trial design recommendations will save practitioners time and resources while allowing for quicker deployments of updates to ML models.},

Study Design and Methods We conducted a systematic review of the use of IV methods in prescription drug research to identify the major types of IVs and the evidence for meeting IV assumptions. We searched MEDLINE, OVID, PsychoInfo, EconLit, and economic databases from 1961 to 2009. Results We identified 26 studies. Most (n=16) were published after 2007. We identified five types of IVs: regional variation (n=8), facility-prescribing patterns (n=5), physician preference (n=8), patient history/financial status (n=3), and calendar time (n=4). Evidence supporting the validity of IV was inconsistent. All studies addressed the first IV assumption; however, there was no standard for demonstrating that the IV sufficiently predicted treatment assignment. For the second assumption, 23 studies provided explicit argument that IV was uncorrelated with the outcome, and 16 supported argument with empirical evidence. Conclusions Use of IV methods is increasing in prescription drug research. However, we did not find evidence of a dominant IV. Future research should develop standards for reporting the validity and strength of IV according to key assumptions.},

  abstract = {In this paper we prove the so-called “Meek Conjecture”.

As shown by Meek (1997), this result has an important consequence for Bayesian approaches to learning Bayesian networks from data: in the limit of large sample size, there exists a twophase greedy search algorithm that—when applied to a particular sparsely-connected search space—provably identifies a perfect map of the generative distribution if that perfect map is a DAG. We provide a new implementation of the search space, using equivalence classes as states, for which all operators used in the greedy search can be scored efficiently using local functions of the nodes in the domain. Finally, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the two-phase greedy approach leads to good solutions when learning with finite sample sizes.},

The following are the key messages(1) In persons older than 50 years, systolic blood pressure (BP) of more than 140 mm Hg is a much more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP; (2) The risk of CVD, beginning at 115/75 mm Hg, doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg; individuals who are normotensive at 55 years of age have a 90\% lifetime risk for developing hypertension; (3) Individuals with a systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg should be considered as prehypertensive and require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent CVD; (4) Thiazide-type diuretics should be used in drug treatment for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes. Certain high-risk conditions are compelling indications for the initial use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers); (5) Most patients with hypertension will require 2 or more antihypertensive medications to achieve goal BP ({$<$}140/90 mm Hg, or {$<$}130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease); (6) If BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal BP, consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 2 agents, 1 of which usually should be a thiazide-type diuretic; and (7) The most effective therapy prescribed by the most careful clinician will control hypertension only if patients are motivated. Motivation improves when patients have positive experiences with and trust in the clinician. Empathy builds trust and is a potent motivator. Finally, in presenting these guidelines, the committee recognizes that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

The kidney is a major player in the pathophysiology of this disease with increased sympathetic activity being the key factor in the initiation and maintenance of drug resistant hypertension in many patients. Thus renal denervation targeted at decreasing sympathetic drive is becoming the apparent choice in carefully selected patients with resistant hypertension who have exhausted all medical options. The Symplicity and EnligHTN trials using first and second generation catheters respectively have demonstrated that renal sympathetic denervation results in significant blood pressure reduction. The initial renal denervation catheter used in the Symplicity trial was a single electrode system. Refinement of this process has led to the EnligHTN catheter's design. This is a multielectrode self-expanding nitinol basket that allows the positioning of the thermal injury pattern to be pre-specified and in theory lead to better positioning of the lesions. We present a review of the premise behind renal artery denervation, discuss the data and early technologies focusing on the characteristics and utility of the first multielectrode renal denervation device, the EnligHTN renal denervation catheter.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare performance of logistic regression (LR) with machine learning (ML) for clinical prediction modeling in the literature. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017) and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for binary outcomes. RESULTS: We included 71 of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72-3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5-563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3-6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68\%) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52-0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34 (0.20-0.47) higher for ML. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of superior performance of ML over LR. Improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms.},

  abstract = {Background Body composition is minimally investigated in an immunotherapy era. Specific body composition signals such as myosteatosis may reflect aspects of patients' immunology and thereby their ability to respond to immunotherapies. Ipilimumab is a key checkpoint inhibitor in metastatic melanoma. As an antibody, it may also be more accurately dosed using body composition parameters rather than weight alone. This retrospective study aimed to investigate body composition-based dosing and outcomes. Methods Pretreatment computed tomography images from metastatic melanoma, ipilimumab-treated patients from 2009 to 2014 were used to measure myosteatosis [skeletal muscle radiographic density or SMD, in Hounsfield units (HU)] and surface area (cm2) as previously described. Cut point analysis determined whether a level of ipilimumab dose and myosteatosis demonstrated differences in progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rates and toxicities. Results Of 121 identified, 97 patients were evaluable. Baseline demographics included 56 years median age, 60\% male participants, and 23.7\% with BRAF mutations. SMD analysis identified cut-offs of SMD {$<$} 42 in those with BMI {$<$} 25 kg/m2 and {$<$}20 HU in those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, respectively. Low SMD patients had poorer median PFS [2.4 vs. 2.7 months, hazard ratio (HR) 1.76, P = 0.008] and OS (5.4 vs. 17.5 months, HR 2.47, P = 0.001), which remained significant in multivariate modelling. High SMD patients had more immune-related adverse events, better objective response rates (17.9 vs. 3.3\%, P = 0.051), and lower baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (21 vs. 39\%, P = 0.049). Separately, patients receiving {$<$}2.03 mg/cm2 had improved median PFS (3.0 vs. 2.6 months, HR 1.88, P = 0.02) and OS (14.9 vs. 5.7 months, HR 1.98, P = 0.01). Conclusions Low SMD and receiving {$>$}2.03 mg/cm2 are prognostic of poorer melanoma outcomes post ipilimumab. SMD may identify patients with flawed immunology and predict who may better respond to such therapy. Ipilimumab dosing by skeletal muscle index stands in contrast to weight-based dosing and may demonstrate a more accurate method of antibody dosing.},

One thread of such debate concerns Explainable AI and its promise to render AI devices more transparent and trustworthy. A few voices active in the medical AI space have expressed concerns on the reliability of Explainable AI techniques, questioning their use and inclusion in guidelines and standards. Revisiting such criticisms, this article offers a balanced and comprehensive perspective on the utility of Explainable AI, focusing on the specificity of clinical applications of AI and placing them in the context of healthcare interventions. Against its detractors and despite valid concerns, we argue that the Explainable AI research program is still central to human-machine interaction and ultimately our main tool against loss of control, a danger that cannot be prevented by rigorous clinical validation alone.},

In particular, we introduce two novel sensitivity measures suited for routine reporting. The robustness value describes the minimum strength of association unobserved confounding would need to have, both with the treatment and with the outcome, to change the research conclusions. The partial R2 of the treatment with the outcome shows how strongly confounders explaining all the residual outcome variation would have to be associated with the treatment to eliminate the estimated effect. Next, we offer graphical tools for elaborating on problematic confounders, examining the sensitivity of point estimates, t-values, as well as “extreme scenarios”. Finally, we describe problems with a common “benchmarking” practice and introduce a novel procedure to formally bound the strength of confounders based on comparison to observed covariates. We apply these methods to a running example that estimates the effect of exposure to violence on attitudes toward peace.},

  abstract = {The kidney and the autonomic nervous system are linked through renal nerves. Activation of efferent renal sympathetic nerves leads to changes in renal vascular resistance, renin release, and Na(+) and water retention. Evidence also exists indicating that the kidney is not just a target organ of sympathetic activity, but also acts as a sensor. Afferent renal nerves have been shown to carry information from renal chemoreceptors, which respond to changes in the composition of the interstitial fluid environment, and mechanoreceptors, which monitor hydrostatic pressure changes within the kidney, to the central nervous system. These afferent renal nerve inputs alter the activity of central integrative neuronal circuits that normally give rise to command signals that influence the function of effector organs. Renal receptors, through their connections at different levels of the neuraxis, are able to reflexly influence not only cardiovascular function through changes in sympathetic nerve discharge to a variety of vascular beds and the hypothalamic release of vasopressin, but also the function of the kidney. This increased sympathetic activity and hormonal release induced by activation of afferent renal nerves has been implicated in hypertension of diverse etiologies.}

  abstract = {Excessive sympathetic drive is a hallmark of chronic heart failure (HF). Disease progression can be correlated with plasma norepinephrine concentration. Renal function is also correlated with disease progression and prognosis. Because both the renal nerves and renin-angiotensin II system are activated in chronic HF we hypothesized that excessive renal sympathetic nerve activity decreases renal blood flow in HF and is associated with changes in angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) expression. The present study was carried out in conscious, chronically instrumented rabbits with pacing-induced HF. We found that rabbits with HF showed a decrease in mean renal blood flow (19.8\&\#xB1;1.6 in HF vs. 32.0\&\#xB1;2.5 ml/min from prepace levels; P\&lt;0.05) and an increase in renal vascular resistance (3.26\&\#xB1;0.29 in HF vs. 2.21\&\#xB1;0.13 mmHg\&\#xB7;ml(-1)\&\#xB7;min in prepace normal rabbits; P\&lt;0.05) while the blood flow and resistance was not changed in HF rabbits with the surgical renal denervation. Renal AT1R expression was increased by \&\#x223C;67\% and AT2R expression was decreased by \&\#x223C;87\% in rabbits with HF; however, kidneys from denervated rabbits with HF showed a near normalization in the expression of these receptors. These results suggest renal sympathetic nerve activity elicits a detrimental effect on renal blood flow and may be associated with alterations in the expression of angiotensin II receptors.},

At present some data have been published on the effects of NACT and perioperative chemotherapy on AGC and Esophago-gastric cancer (EGC) but not definitive ones. The present meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on the AGC and EGC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NACT~+~surgery vs. Surgery in patients with AGC and EGC was performed. RESULTS: 15 RCTs have been included (2001 patients: 977 into NACT~+~surgery arm and 1024 into control arm). NACT~+~Surgery reduces the overall mortality at 1, 3 and 5-year in cumulative analysis (RR~=~0.78; 0.81; 0.88 respectively), at 1, 2, 3 and 5-years in EGC (RR~=~0.79; 0.83; 0.84; 0.91 respectively) and at 3 and 5-years in AGC (RR~=~0.74; 0.82 respectively). Morbidity and perioperative mortality rate are not influenced by NACT. Recurrence rate is reduced by NACT~+~surgery in EGC (RR~=~0.80). CONCLUSIONS: NACT reduces the mortality in gastric and esophago-gastric cancer. Morbidity and perioperative mortality are not influenced by NACT. The overall recurrence rate is reduced by NACT in esophago-gastric cancer.},

Despite the vast empirical evidence supporting this belief, theoretical justifications to date are limited. In particular, they do not account for the locality, sharing and pooling constructs of convolutional networks, the most successful deep learning architecture to date. In this work we derive a deep network architecture based on arithmetic circuits that inherently employs locality, sharing and pooling. An equivalence between the networks and hierarchical tensor factorizations is established. We show that a shallow network corresponds to CP (rank-1) decomposition, whereas a deep network corresponds to Hierarchical Tucker decomposition. Using tools from measure theory and matrix algebra, we prove that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in order to be realized (or even approximated) by a shallow network. Since log-space computation transforms our networks into SimNets, the result applies directly to a deep learning architecture demonstrating promising empirical performance. The construction and theory developed in this paper shed new light on various practices and ideas employed by the deep learning community.},

  abstract = {Background We present a radiomics-based model for predicting response to pembrolizumab in patients with advanced rare cancers. Methods The study included 57 patients with advanced rare cancers who were enrolled in our phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab. Tumor response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST). Patients were categorized as 20 “controlled disease” (stable disease, partial response, or complete response) or 37 progressive disease). We used 3D-slicer to segment target lesions on standard-of-care, pretreatment contrast enhanced CT scans. We extracted 610 features (10 histogram-based features and 600 second-order texture features) from each volume of interest. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression was used to detect the most discriminatory features. Selected features were used to create a classification model, using XGBoost, for the prediction of tumor response to pembrolizumab. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to assess model performance. Findings The 10 most relevant radiomics features were selected; XGBoost-based classification successfully differentiated between controlled disease (complete response, partial response, stable disease) and progressive disease with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in patients assessed by RECIST (94.7\%, 97.3\%, and 90\%, respectively; p{$<$}0.001) and in patients assessed by irRECIST (94.7\%, 93.9\%, and 95.8\%, respectively; p{$<$}0.001). Additionally, the common features of the RECIST and irRECIST groups also highly predicted pembrolizumab response with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and p value of 94.7\%, 97\%, 90\%, p{$<$}0.001\% and 96\%, 96\%, 95\%, p{$<$}0.001, respectively.

  abstract = {Objectives: There is growing awareness of the relationship between sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and function), and outcomes in cancer, making it a potential target for future therapies. In order to inform future research and practice, we undertook a systematic review of factors associated with loss of muscle mass, and the relationship between muscle function and muscle mass in lung cancer, a common condition associated with poor outcomes. Design: We conducted a computerised systematic literature search on five databases. Studies were included if they explored muscle mass as an outcome measure in patients with lung cancer, and were published in English. Setting: Secondary care. Participants: Patients with lung cancer. Primary outcome: Factors associated with loss of muscle mass and muscle function, or sarcopenia, and the clinical impact thereof in patients with lung cancer. Results: We reviewed 5726 citations, and 35 articles were selected for analysis. Sarcopenia, as defined by reduced muscle mass alone, was found to be very prevalent in patients with lung cancer, regardless of body mass index, and where present was associated with poorer functional status and overall survival. There were diverse studies exploring molecular and metabolic factors in the development of loss of muscle mass; however, the precise mechanisms that contribute to sarcopenia and cachexia remain uncertain. The effect of nutritional supplements and ATP infusions on muscle mass showed conflicting results. There are very limited data on the correlation between degree of sarcopenia and muscle function, which has a nonlinear relationship in older non-cancer populations. Conclusions: Loss of muscle mass is a significant contributor to morbidity in patients with lung cancer. Loss of muscle mass and function may predate clinically overt cachexia, underlining the importance of evaluating sarcopenia, rather than weight loss alone. Understanding this relationship and its associated factors will provide opportunities for focused intervention to improve clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor. Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of recommendations for the reporting of studies developing, validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of prediction model studies, it is recommended that authors include a completed checklist in their submission (also available at www.tripod-statement.org).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) statement was published in 2015 to provide the minimum reporting recommendations for studies developing or evaluating the performance of a prediction model. Methodological advances in the field of prediction have since included the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) powered by machine learning methods to develop prediction models. An update to the TRIPOD statement is thus needed. TRIPOD+AI provides harmonised guidance for reporting prediction model studies, irrespective of whether regression modelling or machine learning methods have been used.

  abstract = {There are many measures to report so-called treatment or causal effect: absolute difference, ratio, odds ratio, number needed to treat, and so on. The choice of a measure, eg absolute versus relative, is often debated because it leads to different appreciations of the same phenomenon; but it also implies different heterogeneity of treatment effect. In addition some measures -- but not all -- have appealing properties such as collapsibility, matching the intuition of a population summary. We review common measures and their pros and cons typically brought forward. Doing so, we clarify notions of collapsibility and treatment effect heterogeneity, unifying different existing definitions. Our main contribution is to propose to reverse the thinking: rather than starting from the measure, we start from a non-parametric generative model of the outcome. Depending on the nature of the outcome, some causal measures disentangle treatment modulations from baseline risk. Therefore, our analysis outlines an understanding what heterogeneity and homogeneity of treatment effect mean, not through the lens of the measure, but through the lens of the covariates. Our goal is the generalization of causal measures. We show that different sets of covariates are needed to generalize an effect to a different target population depending on (i) the causal measure of interest, (ii) the nature of the outcome, and (iii) the generalization's method itself (generalizing either conditional outcome or local effects).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Definitive chemoradiotherapy is a curative treatment option for oesophageal carcinoma, especially in patients unsuitable for surgery. The PRODIGE5/ACCORD17 trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the FOLFOX treatment regimen (fluorouracil plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin) versus fluorouracil and cisplatin as part of chemoradiotherapy in patients with localised oesophageal cancer. METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 2/3 trial of patients aged 18 years or older enrolled from 24 centres in France between Oct 15, 2004, and Aug 25, 2011. Eligible participants had confirmed stage I-IVA oesophageal carcinoma (adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell, or adenosquamous), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0-2, sufficient caloric intake, adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function, and had been selected to receive definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either six cycles (three concomitant to radiotherapy) of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), leucovorin 200 mg/m(2), bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2), and infusional fluorouracil 1600 mg/m(2) (FOLFOX) over 46 h, or four cycles (two concomitant to radiotherapy) of fluorouracil 1000 mg/m(2) per day for 4 days and cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1. Both groups also received 50 Gy radiotherapy in 25 fractions (five fractions per week). Random allocation to treatment groups was done by a central computerised randomisation procedure by minimisation, stratified by centre, histology, weight loss, and ECOG status, and was achieved independently from the study investigators. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Data analysis was primarily done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00861094. FINDINGS: 134 participants were randomly allocated to the FOLFOX group and 133 to the fluorouracil and cisplatin group (intention-to-treat population), and 131 patients in the FOLFOX group and 128 in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group actually received the study drugs (safety population). Median follow-up was 25·3 months (IQR 15·9-36·4). Median progression-free survival was 9·7 months (95\% CI 8·1-14·5) in the FOLFOX group and 9·4 months (8·1-10·6) in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group (HR 0·93, 95\% CI 0·70-1·24; p=0·64). One toxic death occurred in the FOLFOX group and six in the fluorouracil-cisplatin group (p=0·066). No significant differences were recorded in the rates of most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events between the treatment groups. Of all-grade adverse events that occurred in 5\% or more of patients, paraesthesia (61 [47\%] events in 131 patients in the FOLFOX group vs three [2\%] in 128 patients in the cisplatin-fluorouracil group, p{$<$}0·0001), sensory neuropathy (24 [18\%] vs one [1\%], p{$<$}0·0001), increases in aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (14 [11\%] vs two [2\%], p=0·002), and increases in alanine aminotransferase concentrations (11 [8\%] vs two [2\%], p=0·012) were more common in the FOLFOX group, whereas serum creatinine increases (four [3\%] vs 15 [12\%], p=0·007), mucositis (35 [27\%] vs 41 [32\%], p=0·011), and alopecia (two [2\%] vs 12 [9\%], p=0·005) were more common in the fluorouracil and cisplatin group. INTERPRETATION: Although chemoradiotherapy with FOLFOX did not increase progression-free survival compared with chemoradiotherapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin, FOLFOX might be a more convenient option for patients with localised oesophageal cancer unsuitable for surgery.

  abstract = {This paper describes the application of eight statistical and machine-learning methods to derive computer models for predicting mortality of hospital patients with pneumonia from their findings at initial presentation. The eight models were each constructed based on 9847 patient cases and they were each evaluated on 4352 additional cases. The primary evaluation metric was the error in predicted survival as a function of the fraction of patients predicted to survive. This metric is useful in assessing a model's potential to assist a clinician in deciding whether to treat a given patient in the hospital or at home. We examined the error rates of the models when predicting that a given fraction of patients will survive. We examined survival fractions between 0.1 and 0.6. Over this range, each model's predictive error rate was within 1\% of the error rate of every other model. When predicting that approximately 30\% of the patients will survive, all the models have an error rate of less than 1.5\%. The models are distinguished more by the number of variables and parameters that they contain than by their error rates; these differences suggest which models may be the most amenable to future implementation as paper-based guidelines.},

  abstract = {Baseline clinical prognostic factors for recurrent and/or metastatic (RM) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with immunotherapy are lacking. CT-based radiomics may provide additional prognostic information. A total of 85 patients with RM-HNSCC were enrolled for this study. For each tumor, radiomic features were extracted from the segmentation of the largest tumor mass. A pipeline including different feature selection steps was used to train a radiomic signature prognostic for 10-month overall survival (OS). Features were selected based on their stability to geometrical transformation of the segmentation (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC \&gt; 0.75) and their predictive power (area under the curve, AUC \&gt; 0.7). The predictive model was developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in combination with the support vector machine. The model was developed based on the first 68 enrolled patients and tested on the last 17 patients. Classification performance of the radiomic risk was evaluated accuracy and the AUC. The same metrics were computed for some baseline predictors used in clinical practice (volume of largest lesion, total tumor volume, number of tumor lesions, number of affected organs, performance status). The AUC in the test set was 0.67, while accuracy was 0.82. The performance of the radiomic score was higher than the one obtainable with the clinical variables (largest lesion volume: accuracy 0.59, AUC = 0.55; number of tumoral lesions: accuracy 0.71, AUC 0.36; number of affected organs: accuracy 0.47; AUC 0.42; total tumor volume: accuracy 0.59, AUC 0.53; performance status: accuracy 0.41, AUC = 0.47).

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate currently used recurrence prediction models for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by using prospective data from the ASSURE (ECOG-ACRIN E2805; Adjuvant Sorafenib or Sunitinib for Unfavorable Renal Carcinoma) adjuvant trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight RCC recurrence models (University of California at Los Angeles Integrated Staging System [UISS]; Stage, Size, Grade, and Necrosis [SSIGN]; Leibovich; Kattan; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC]; Yaycioglu; Karakiewicz; and Cindolo) were selected on the basis of their use in clinical practice and clinical trial designs. These models along with the TNM staging system were validated using 1,647 patients with resected localized high-grade or locally advanced disease (≥ pT1b grade 3 and 4/pTanyN1Mo) from the ASSURE cohort. The predictive performance of the model was quantified by assessing its discriminatory and calibration abilities. RESULTS: Prospective validation of predictive and prognostic models for localized RCC showed a substantial decrease in each of the predictive abilities of the model compared with their original and externally validated discriminatory estimates. Among the models, the SSIGN score performed best (0.688; 95\% CI, 0.686 to 0.689), and the UISS model performed worst (0.556; 95\% CI, 0.555 to 0.557). Compared with the 2002 TNM staging system (C-index, 0.60), most models only marginally outperformed standard staging. Importantly, all models, including TNM, demonstrated statistically significant variability in their predictive ability over time and were most useful within the first 2 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In RCC, as in many other solid malignancies, clinicians rely on retrospective prediction tools to guide patient care and clinical trial selection and largely overestimate their predictive abilities. We used prospective collected adjuvant trial data to validate existing RCC prediction models and demonstrate a sharp decrease in the predictive ability of all models compared with their previous retrospective validations. Accordingly, we recommend prospective validation of any predictive model before implementing it into clinical practice and clinical trial design.},

  abstract = {Background: Sarcopenia and muscle tissue degradation are hallmarks of the majority of chronic diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A computed tomography scan could be an easy modality to estimate the skeletal muscle mass through cross-sectional image analysis at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Methods: Baseline skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was evaluated through the skeletal muscle index (SMI), together with skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD), in NSCLC patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy to evaluate correlations with safety and clinical outcomes. When SMIs at different time points were available, further comparison was made between patients with worse and improved SMIs. Results: Among 81 stage IV NSCLC patients, 28 had low SMM and 23 had low SMD. There were no significant differences in univariate analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) between patients with baseline low and non-low SMM (P = 0.06388) or between patients with low and non-low SMD (P = 0.9126). Baseline low SMM, however, proved a significant predictor of shorter PFS in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.31–0.93; P = 0.0278), but not low SMD. There were no differences in overall survival (OS) between patients with baseline low and non-low SMM or low and non-low SMD. No differences in PFS and OS between evaluable patients with worse or improved SMI were found. A significant difference in hematological toxicities between patients with baseline low and non-low SMM (P = 0.0358) was observed. Conclusions: Low SMM is predictive of shorter PFS, while consecutive changes in muscular mass do not seem to be a predictor of PFS or OS.

  abstract = {Sarcopenia represents one of the hallmarks of all chronic diseases, including cancer, and was already investigated as a prognostic marker in the pre-immunotherapy era. Sarcopenia can be evaluated using cross-sectional image analysis of CT-scans, at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3), to estimate the skeletal muscle index (SMI), a surrogate of skeletal muscle mass, and to evaluate the skeletal muscle density (SMD). We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive advanced cancer patient treated with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. Baseline SMI and SMD were evaluated and optimal cut-offs for survival, according to sex and BMI (+/−25) were computed. The evaluated clinical outcomes were: objective response rate (ORR), immune-related adverse events (irAEs), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). From April 2015 to April 2019, 100 consecutive advanced cancer patients were evaluated. 50 (50\%) patients had a baseline low SMI, while 51 (51\%) had a baseline low SMD according to the established cut offs. We found a significant association between SMI and ECOG-PS (p = 0.0324), while no correlations were found regarding SMD and baseline clinical factors. The median follow-up was 20.3 months. Patients with low SMI had a significantly shorter PFS (HR = 1.66 [95\% CI: 1.05–2.61]; p = 0.0291) at univariate analysis, but not at the multivariate analysis. They also had a significantly shorter OS (HR = 2.19 [95\% CI: 1.31–3.64]; p = 0.0026). The multivariate analysis confirmed baseline SMI as an independent predictor for OS (HR = 2.19 [1.31–3.67]; p = 0.0027). We did not find significant relationships between baseline SMD and clinical outcomes, nor between ORR, irAEs and baseline SMI (data not shown). Low SMI is associated with shortened survival in advanced cancer patients treated with PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors. However, the lack of an association between SMI and clinical response suggests that sarcopenia may be generally prognostic in this setting rather than specifically predictive of response to immunotherapy. © 2020, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Algorithmic risk assessments are increasingly used to help humans make decisions in high-stakes settings, such as medicine, criminal justice and education. In each of these cases, the purpose of the risk assessment tool is to inform actions, such as medical treatments or release conditions, often with the aim of reducing the likelihood of an adverse event such as hospital readmission or recidivism. Problematically, most tools are trained and evaluated on historical data in which the outcomes observed depend on the historical decision-making policy. These tools thus reflect risk under the historical policy, rather than under the different decision options that the tool is intended to inform. Even when tools are constructed to predict risk under a specific decision, they are often improperly evaluated as predictors of the target outcome. Focusing on the evaluation task, in this paper we define counterfactual analogues of common predictive performance and algorithmic fairness metrics that we argue are better suited for the decision-making context. We introduce a new method for estimating the proposed metrics using doubly robust estimation. We provide theoretical results that show that only under strong conditions can fairness according to the standard metric and the counterfactual metric simultaneously hold. Consequently, fairness-promoting methods that target parity in a standard fairness metric may --- and as we show empirically, do --- induce greater imbalance in the counterfactual analogue. We provide empirical comparisons on both synthetic data and a real world child welfare dataset to demonstrate how the proposed method improves upon standard practice.},

  abstract = {Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive cancer primarily diagnosed on the basis of histological criteria1. The 2015 World Health Organization classification subdivides mesothelioma tumors into three histological types: epithelioid, biphasic and sarcomatoid MM. MM is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease, rendering its diagnosis and histological typing difficult and leading to suboptimal patient care and decisions regarding treatment modalities2. Here we have developed a new approach-based on deep convolutional neural networks-called MesoNet to accurately predict the overall survival of mesothelioma patients from whole-slide digitized images, without any pathologist-provided locally annotated regions. We validated MesoNet on both an internal validation cohort from the French MESOBANK and an independent cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also demonstrated that the model was more accurate in predicting patient survival than using current pathology practices. Furthermore, unlike classical black-box deep learning methods, MesoNet identified regions contributing to patient outcome prediction. Strikingly, we found that these regions are mainly located in the stroma and are histological features associated with inflammation, cellular diversity and vacuolization. These findings suggest that deep learning models can identify new features predictive of patient survival and potentially lead to new biomarker discoveries.},

Not surprisingly, the techniques required were more demanding than those used for the quantification of field and object parameters in the nervous system. The following areas of methodology have been shown to be important: (1) use of buffers free of metallic ions for tissue processing, (2) selection and titration of first and second layer antibodies, (3) reduction and control of fading of fluorescence, (4) selection of microscopical and imaging equipment to give accurate, sensitive and uniform representations of low-light biological images, and (5) use of appropriate image analysis algorithms in order to generate binary images that match the spatial and intensity distributions of immunostaining. Incorporation of these techniques into our assay system gave sensitive measurements of the time-scale of uptake of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) into sympathetic nerve terminals. The microscopical assay appears to have advantages over alternative approaches used for studies of neurotransmitter dynamics, particularly in small, heterogeneous tissue samples.},

  abstract = {Two concepts for the long-term regulation of arterial pressure were considered in this review, the neural control hypothesis and the volume regulation hypothesis. The role of the nervous system and fluid volume regulation are intertwined in a way that has made it difficult to experimentally evaluate their separate contributions in the long-term regulation of arterial pressure. Nevertheless, from a substantial body of work related to the neural control of cardiovascular function, it appears that the ability of the nervous system to control arterial pressure is limited to the detection and correction of rapid short-term changes of arterial pressure. A long and exhaustive search has yet yielded no new neural mechanisms beyond the classic sinoaortic baroreceptors that can detect changes of arterial pressure. The baroreceptor mechanisms are of great importance for the moment-to-moment stabilization of arterial pressure, but because they do not possess sufficient strength and because they reset in time to the prevailing level of arterial pressure, they cannot provide a sustained negative feedback signal to provide long-term regulation of arterial pressure in face of sustained stimuli. This is not to say that the nervous system cannot affect the long-term level of arterial pressure. A distinction is made here between the many factors that can influence the long-term level of pressure and those that actually serve to detect changes of pressure and serve to maintain the level of pressure within a narrow range over the period of our adult lifetime. In this sense, there is evidence that in genetically susceptible individuals, environmental stresses can influence the long-term level of arterial pressure via the central and peripheral neural autonomic pathways. It is inappropriate, however, to view the nervous system as a long-term controller of arterial pressure because there is yet no evidence that the CNS can detect changes of arterial pressure nor changes in total body sodium and water content over sustained periods whereby it could provide an adequate long-term normalization of such error signals. In contrast, evidence has grown in support of the renal pressure-diuresis volume regulation hypothesis for the long-term control of arterial pressure over the past decade. An enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of pressure diuresis-natriuresis coupled with studies exploring how changes of vascular volume can influence vascular smooth muscle tone provide a compelling basis for this hypothesis of long-term arterial pressure regulation. This overall concept is represented and summarized in Figure 12.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Throughout the last decade many laboratories have shown that mRNA levels in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FPE) tissue specimens can be quantified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques despite the extensive RNA fragmentation that occurs in tissues so preserved. We have developed RT-PCR methods that are sensitive, precise, and that have multianalyte capability for potential wide use in clinical research and diagnostic assays. Here it is shown that the extent of fragmentation of extracted FPE tissue RNA significantly increases with archive storage time. Probe and primer sets for RT-PCR assays based on amplicons that are both short and homogeneous in length enable effective reference gene-based data normalization for cross comparison of specimens that differ substantially in age. A 48-gene assay used to compare gene expression profiles from the same breast cancer tissue that had been either frozen or FPE showed very similar profiles after reference gene-based normalization. A 92-gene assay, using RNA extracted from three 10-μm FPE sections of archival breast cancer specimens (dating from 1985 to 2001) yielded analyzable data for these genes in all 62 tested specimens. The results were substantially concordant when estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status determined by RT-PCR was compared with immunohistochemistry assays for these receptors. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of RT-PCR over immunohistochemistry with respect to quantitation and dynamic range. These findings support the development of RT-PCR analysis of FPE tissue RNA as a platform for multianalyte clinical diagnostic tests.},

This paper presents our updated findings.to increase consistency of research design, clinical diagnoses and ultimately, care for people with sarcopenia.sarcopenia is a muscle disease (muscle failure) rooted in adverse muscle changes that accrue across a lifetime; sarcopenia is common among adults of older age but can also occur earlier in life. In this updated consensus paper on sarcopenia, EWGSOP2: (1) focuses on low muscle strength as a key characteristic of sarcopenia, uses detection of low muscle quantity and quality to confirm the sarcopenia diagnosis, and identifies poor physical performance as indicative of severe sarcopenia; (2) updates the clinical algorithm that can be used for sarcopenia case-finding, diagnosis and confirmation, and severity determination and (3) provides clear cut-off points for measurements of variables that identify and characterise sarcopenia.EWGSOP2's updated recommendations aim to increase awareness of sarcopenia and its risk. With these new recommendations, EWGSOP2 calls for healthcare professionals who treat patients at risk for sarcopenia to take actions that will promote early detection and treatment. We also encourage more research in the field of sarcopenia in order to prevent or delay adverse health outcomes that incur a heavy burden for patients and healthcare systems.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of chemotherapy with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) compared with TRT alone has been shown to confer a survival advantage for good performance status patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is not known whether sequential or concurrent delivery of these therapies is the optimal combination strategy. METHODS: A total of 610 patients were randomly assigned to two concurrent regimens and one sequential chemotherapy and TRT regimen in a three-arm phase III trial. The sequential arm included cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29 and vinblastine at 5 mg/m2 per week for 5 weeks with 63 Gy TRT delivered as once-daily fractions beginning on day 50. Arm 2 used the same chemotherapy regimen as arm 1 with 63 Gy TRT delivered as once-daily fractions beginning on day 1 [corrected]. Arm 3 used cisplatin at 50 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 with oral etoposide at 50 mg twice daily for 10 weeks on days 1, 2, 5, and 6 with 69.6 Gy delivered as 1.2 Gy twice-daily fractions beginning on day 1. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and secondary endpoints included tumor response and time to tumor progression. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess survival, and toxic effects were examined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Median survival times were 14.6, 17.0, and 15.6 months for arms 1-3, respectively. Five-year survival was statistically significantly higher for patients treated with the concurrent regimen with once-daily TRT compared with the sequential treatment (5-year survival: sequential, arm 1, 10\% [20 patients], 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 7\% to 15\%; concurrent, arm 2, 16\% [31 patients], 95\% CI = 11\% to 22\%, P = .046; concurrent, arm 3, 13\% [22 patients], 95\% CI = 9\% to 18\%). With a median follow-up time of 11 years, the rates of acute grade 3-5 nonhematologic toxic effects were higher with concurrent than sequential therapy, but late toxic effects were similar. CONCLUSION: Concurrent delivery of cisplatin-based chemotherapy with TRT confers a long-term survival benefit compared with the sequential delivery of these therapies.},

We thus performed several computed  tomography (CT)-based morphometric measurements of sarcopenia in 238 consecutive  non-small cell lung-cancer patients undergoing pneumonectomy from 1 January 2007 to  31 December 2015. Sarcopenia was assessed by the following CT-based parameters:  cross-sectional total psoas area (TPA), cross-sectional total muscle area (TMA), and  total parietal muscle area (TPMA), defined as TMA without TPA. Measures were  performed at the level of the third lumbar vertebra and were obtained for the entire  muscle surface, as well as by excluding fatty infiltration based on CT attenuation.  Findings were stratified for gender, and a threshold of the 33rd percentile was set  to define sarcopenia. Furthermore, we assessed the possibility of being sarcopenic  at both the TPA and TPMA level, or not, by taking into account of not fatty  infiltration. Five-year survival was 39.1\% for the whole population. Lower TPA, TMA,  and TPA were associated with lower survival at univariate analysis; taking into  account muscular fatty infiltration did not result in more powerful discrimination.  Being sarcopenic at both psoas and parietal muscle level had the optimum  discriminating power. At the multivariable analysis, being sarcopenic at both psoas  and parietal muscles (considering the whole muscle areas, including muscular fat),  male sex, increasing age, and tumor stage, as well as Charlson Comorbidity Index  (CCI), were independently associated with worse long-term outcomes. We conclude that  sarcopenia is a powerful negative prognostic factor in patients with lung cancer  treated by pneumonectomy.},

  abstract = {Many medical journals, including JAMA, restrict the use of causal language to the reporting of randomized clinical trials. Although well-conducted randomized clinical trials remain the preferred approach for answering causal questions, methods for observational studies have advanced such that causal interpretations of the results of well-conducted observational studies may be possible when strong assumptions hold. Furthermore, observational studies may be the only practical source of information for answering some questions about the causal effects of medical or policy interventions, can support the study of interventions in populations and settings that reflect practice, and can help identify interventions for further experimental investigation. Identifying opportunities for the appropriate use of causal language when describing observational studies is important for communication in medical journals.A structured approach to whether and how causal language may be used when describing observational studies would enhance the communication of research goals, support the assessment of assumptions and design and analytic choices, and allow for more clear and accurate interpretation of results. Building on the extensive literature on causal inference across diverse disciplines, we suggest a framework for observational studies that aim to provide evidence about the causal effects of interventions based on 6 core questions: what is the causal question; what quantity would, if known, answer the causal question; what is the study design; what causal assumptions are being made; how can the observed data be used to answer the causal question in principle and in practice; and is a causal interpretation of the analyses tenable?Adoption of the proposed framework to identify when causal interpretation is appropriate in observational studies promises to facilitate better communication between authors, reviewers, editors, and readers. Practical implementation will require cooperation between editors, authors, and reviewers to operationalize the framework and evaluate its effect on the reporting of empirical research.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are increasing worldwide, especially in ICUs, and have been associated with high mortality rates. However, unequivocally demonstrating causality of such infections to death is difficult in critically ill patients because of potential confounding and competing events. Here, we quantified the effects of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae carriage on patient outcome in two Greek ICUs with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae endemicity. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: Two ICUs with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae endemicity. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the ICU with an expected length of ICU stay of at least 3 days were included. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization was established through screening in perineum swabs obtained at admission and twice weekly and inoculated on chromogenic plates. Detection of carbapenemases was performed phenotypically, with confirmation by polymerase chain reaction. Risk factors for ICU mortality were evaluated using cause-specific hazard ratios and subdistribution hazard ratios, with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization as time-varying covariate. One thousand seven patients were included, 36 (3.6\%) were colonized at admission, and 96 (9.5\%) acquired carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization during ICU stay, and 301 (29.9\%) died in ICU. Of 132 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 125 (94.7\%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae and 74 harbored K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (56.1\%), 54 metallo-β-lactamase (40.9\%), and four both (3.0\%). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization was associated with a statistically significant increase of the subdistribution hazard ratio for ICU mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio=1.79; 95\% CI, 1.31-2.43), not explained by an increased daily hazard of dying (cause-specific hazard ratio for death=1.02; 95\% CI, 0.74-1.41), but by an increased length of stay (cause-specific hazard ratio for discharge alive=0.73; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.94). Other risk factors in the subdistribution hazard model were Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (subdistribution hazard ratio=1.13; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.15), female gender (subdistribution hazard ratio=1.29; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.62), presence of solid tumor (subdistribution hazard ratio=1.54; 95\% CI, 1.15-2.06), hematopoietic malignancy (subdistribution hazard ratio=1.61; 95\% CI, 1.04-2.51), and immunodeficiency (subdistribution hazard ratio=1.59; 95\% CI, 1.11-2.27). CONCLUSIONS: Patients colonized with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae have on average a 1.79 times higher hazard of dying in ICU than noncolonized patients, primarily because of an increased length of stay.},

We collected clinical data from metastatic melanoma patients treated at two centers who received anti-PD-1 (n=303) or anti-PD-1 + ipilimumab (n=57). We correlated number of metastases, diameter of largest tumor (tumor bulk), and organ involvement with response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with diameter of largest tumor ≤ 2cm had a 53\% RR while those with largest tumor {$>$}2cm had a 38\% RR (p=0.009). Those with liver metastases had lower RR (25\% vs. 43\%, p=0.002). RR to anti-PD-1 was greater in patients with ≤10 metastases compared with those with {$>$}10 (39\% vs. 27\%, p=0.027). In multivariable analyses, size of the largest tumor was independently associated with PFS (p=0.0005), OS (p{$<$}0.0001), and RR (p=0.02) whereas AJCC stage, lactate dehydrogenase, liver metastases, ECOG performance status, number of metastases, and prior therapies were not. In patients treated with anti-PD-1 + ipilimumab, however, tumor bulk was not associated with outcomes, although number of metastases was associated with PFS (p=0.035) and RR (p=0.009) but not OS. Pathologic analysis did not reveal differences in T cell infiltration in bulky vs. small tumors. Tumor bulk, defined by diameter of largest tumor, was strongly and independently associated with clinical outcomes in anti-PD-1 but not in anti-PD-1 + ipilimumab.

In the corpus striatum and cerebral cortex, NO synthase immunoreactivity and NADPH diaphorase staining are colocalized in medium to large aspiny neurons. These same neurons colocalize with somatostatin and neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity. NO synthase immunoreactivity and NADPH diaphorase staining are colocalized in the pedunculopontine nucleus with choline acetyltransferase-containing cells and are also colocalized in amacrine cells of the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cells of the retina, myenteric plexus neurons of the intestine, and ganglion cells of the adrenal medulla. Transfection of human kidney cells with NO synthase cDNA elicits NADPH diaphorase staining. The ratio of NO synthase to NADPH diaphorase staining in the transfected cells is the same as in neurons, indicating that NO synthase fully accounts for observed NADPH staining. The identity of neuronal NO synthase and NADPH diaphorase suggests a role for NO in modulating neurotoxicity.},

  abstract = {The exposure of the fetus to a hyperglycemic environment promotes the development of hypertension and renal dysfunction in the offspring at adult age. We evaluated the role of renal nerves in the hypertension and renal changes seen in offspring of diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in female Wistar rats (streptozotocin, 60 mg/kg ip) before mating. Male offspring from control and diabetic dams were studied at an age of 3 mo. Systolic blood pressure measured by tail cuff was increased in offspring of diabetic dams (146 \&\#xB1; 1.6 mmHg, n = 19, compared with 117 \&\#xB1; 1.4 mmHg, n = 18, in controls). Renal function, baseline renal sympathetic nerve activity (rSNA), and arterial baroreceptor control of rSNA were analyzed in anesthetized animals. Glomerular filtration rate, fractional sodium excretion, and urine flow were significantly reduced in offspring of diabetic dams. Two weeks after renal denervation, blood pressure and renal function in offspring from diabetic dams were similar to control, suggesting that renal nerves contribute to sodium retention in offspring from diabetic dams. Moreover, basal rSNA was increased in offspring from diabetic dams, and baroreceptor control of rSNA was impaired, with blunted responses to infusion of nitroprusside and phenylephrine. Thus, data from this study indicate that in offspring from diabetic mothers, renal nerves have a clear role in the etiology of hypertension; however, other factors may also contribute to this condition.},

Here, we used data from the Coronary Drug Project (CDP) trial to assess a range of approaches to directed acyclic graph (DAG) creation. We focused on the effect of adherence on mortality in the placebo arm, since the true causal effect is believed with a high degree of certainty.           Methods:~           We created DAGs for the effect of placebo adherence on mortality using different approaches for identifying variables and links to include or exclude. For each DAG, we identified minimal adjustment sets of covariates for estimating our causal effect of interest, and applied these to analyses of the CDP data.           Results:~           When we used only baseline covariate values to estimate the cumulative effect of placebo adherence on mortality, all adjustment sets performed similarly. The specific choice of covariates had minimal effect on these (biased) point estimates, but including non-confounding prognostic factors resulted in smaller variance estimates. When we additionally adjusted for time-varying covariates of adherence using inverse probability weighting, covariates identified from the DAG created by focusing on prognostic factors performed best.           Conclusion:~           Theoretical advice on covariate selection suggests including prognostic factors that are not exposure predictors can reduce variance without increasing bias. In contrast, for exposure predictors that are not prognostic factors, inclusion may result in less bias control. Our results empirically confirm this advice. We recommend that hand-creating DAGs begin with identification of all potential outcome-prognostic factors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It is widely acknowledged that the performance of diagnostic and prognostic prediction models should be assessed in external validation studies with independent data from "different but related" samples as compared with that of the development sample. We developed a framework of methodological steps and statistical methods for analyzing and enhancing the interpretation of results from external validation studies of prediction models. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We propose to quantify the degree of relatedness between development and validation samples on a scale ranging from reproducibility to transportability by evaluating their corresponding case-mix differences. We subsequently assess the models' performance in the validation sample and interpret the performance in view of the case-mix differences. Finally, we may adjust the model to the validation setting. RESULTS: We illustrate this three-step framework with a prediction model for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis using three validation samples with varying case mix. While one external validation sample merely assessed the model's reproducibility, two other samples rather assessed model transportability. The performance in all validation samples was adequate, and the model did not require extensive updating to correct for miscalibration or poor fit to the validation settings. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework enhances the interpretation of findings at external validation of prediction models.},

  abstract = {The hypertensive double transgenic rat harboring both the human renin and human angiotensinogen genes (dTGR) offers a unique opportunity to study the human renin-angiotensin system in an experimental animal model. Since nothing is known about the control of sodium and water excretion in these rats, this study was performed to compare pressure-natriuresis relationships in hypertensive dTGR and normotensive control rats harboring only the human renin gene (hREN), in order to determine how the pressure-natriuresis relationship is reset in hypertensive dTGR. To differentiate between extrinsic and intrinsic renal mechanisms, experiments were performed with and without renal denervation, and with and without infusions of vasopressin, norepinephrine, 17-OH-corticosterone, and aldosterone. Human and rat angiotensinogen and renin mRNA expression were also determined. In hREN without controlled renal function, urine flow and sodium excretion increased from 13 to 169 microl/min per g kidney wet weight (kwt) and from 1 to 30 micromol/min per g kwt, respectively, as renal perfusion pressure was increased from 67 to 135 mmHg. Renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR ranged between 3 to 7 and 0.9 to 1.5 ml/min per g kwt. In dTGR, pressure-natriuresis-diuresis relationships were shifted approximately 40 mmHg rightward. RBF was lower in dTGR than in hREN; GFR was not different. In dTGR with neurohormonal factors controlled, RBF was decreased and pressure-natriuresis-diuresis curves were not different compared to dTGR curves without these interventions. By light microscopy, the kidneys of these 6-wk-old dTGR and hREN rats were normal and indistinguishable. Both human and rat renin and angiotensinogen mRNA were expressed in the kidneys of dTGR. The two renin mRNA were decreased in dTGR, indicating a physiologic downregulation of renin gene expression by high BP. It is concluded that the renal pressure-natriuresis mechanism is reset toward higher pressure levels in dTGR and participates in the maintenance of hypertension. The reduced excretory function in dTGR depends on hREN and human angiotensinogen gene expression and is intrinsic to the kidney as opposed to extrarenal regulators.},

Analytic morphomics is the technique to use body composition measures as imaging biomarkers for underlying pathophysiology to predict prognosis or outcome to therapy.~We investigated different body composition measures to predict response to immunotherapy. This IRB approved retrospective analysis encompassed 147 patients with ipilimumab therapy. Degree of macroangiopathy was quantified with the newly defined total plaque index (TPI), i.e. the body height corrected sum of the soft and hard plaque volume of the infrarenal aorta on portalvenous CT scans. Furthermore, mean psoas density (MPD), different adipose tissue parameters as well as degree of cerebral microangiopathy were extracted from the imaging data. Subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis encompassed TPI, MPD, serum LDH, S100B, age, gender, number of immunotherapy cycles as well as extent of distant metastases. TPI and MPD correlated positively with PFS in multivariate analysis (p\,=\,0.03 and p\,=\,0.001, respectively). Furthermore, single visceral organ and/or soft tissue involvement significantly decreased progression risk (p\,=\,0.01), whereas increased S100B level showed a trend towards PFS shortening (p\,=\,0.05). In conclusion, degree of macroangiopathy and sarcopenia were independent predictors for outcome to immunotherapy and of equivalent significance compared to other clinical biomarkers.},

The question addressed was 'Does sarcopenia have any impact on survival of  patients with surgically treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)?'. Altogether,  342 papers were found using the reported search, of which 9 cohort studies  represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal,  date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant  outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Eight of the studies measured  skeletal muscle or total psoas cross-sectional area at the level of the first or  third lumbar vertebra normalized for the square of height for defining sarcopenia,  while 1 study used absolute measurement of total psoas cross-sectional area. Seven  of 8 studies looking at overall survival found that patients with sarcopenia had  significantly worse overall survival than those without after surgical resection of  NSCLC, while 1 failed to show a difference. Five studies reported disease-free  survival, with 3 studies showing no difference and 2 showing that patients with  sarcopenia had a significantly worse disease-free survival than those without. One  study found that sarcopenia was a predictor of early recurrence in NSCLC patient  after surgical resection. Therefore, we conclude that sarcopenia could serve as a  predictor of poor prognosis of patients with surgically treated NSCLC.},

In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data.},

  abstract = {Background Computed tomography (CT) emphysema quantification is affected by both radiation dose (i.e. image noise) and reconstruction technique. At reduced dose, filtered back projection (FBP) results in an overestimation of the amount of emphysema due to higher noise levels, while the use of iterative reconstruction (IR) can result in an underestimation due to reduced noise. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of dose reduction and hybrid IR (HIR) or model-based IR (MIR) on CT emphysema quantification. Methods Twenty-two patients underwent inspiratory chest CT scan at routine radiation dose and at 45\%, 60\% and 75\% reduced radiation dose. Acquisitions were reconstructed with FBP, HIR and MIR. Emphysema was quantified using the 15th percentile of the attenuation curve and the percentage of voxels below -950 HU. To determine whether the use of a different percentile or HU threshold is more accurate at reduced dose levels and with IR, additional measurements were performed using different percentiles and HU thresholds to determine the optimal combination. Results Dose reduction resulted in a significant overestimation of emphysema, while HIR and MIR resulted in an underestimation. Lower HU thresholds with FBP at reduced dose and higher HU thresholds with HIR and MIR resulted in emphysema percentages comparable to the reference. The 15th percentile quantification method showed similar results as the HU threshold method. Conclusions This within-patients study showed that CT emphysema quantification is significantly affected by dose reduction and IR. This can potentially be solved by adapting commonly used thresholds.

Methods: In this prospective study, 25 patients scheduled for follow-up of pulmonary nodules were included.

Data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid IR, and model-based IR. Volumetry was performed using semiautomatic software. Results: At the highest dose level, more than 91\% (34/37) of the nodules could be segmented, and at the lowest dose level, this was more than 83\%. Thirty-three nodules were included for further analysis. Filtered back projection and hybrid IR did not lead to significant differences, whereas model-based IR resulted in lower volume measurements with a maximum difference of −11\% compared with FBP at routine dose.

  abstract = {Purpose: Using standard-of-care CT images obtained from patients with a diagnosis of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we defined radiomics signatures predicting the sensitivity of tumors to nivolumab, docetaxel, and gefitinib. Experimental Design: Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively across multicenter clinical trials [nivolumab, n = 92, CheckMate017 (NCT01642004), CheckMate063 (NCT01721759); docetaxel, n = 50, CheckMate017; gefitinib, n = 46, (NCT00588445)]. Patients were randomized to training or validation cohorts using either a 4:1 ratio (nivolumab: 72T:20V) or a 2:1 ratio (docetaxel: 32T:18V; gefitinib: 31T:15V) to ensure an adequate sample size in the validation set. Radiomics signatures were derived from quantitative analysis of early tumor changes from baseline to first on-treatment assessment. For each patient, 1,160 radiomics features were extracted from the largest measurable lung lesion. Tumors were classified as treatment sensitive or insensitive; reference standard was median progression-free survival (NCT01642004, NCT01721759) or surgery (NCT00588445). Machine learning was implemented to select up to four features to develop a radiomics signature in the training datasets and applied to each patient in the validation datasets to classify treatment sensitivity. Results: The radiomics signatures predicted treatment sensitivity in the validation dataset of each study group with AUC (95 confidence interval): nivolumab, 0.77 (0.55–1.00); docetaxel, 0.67 (0.37–0.96); and gefitinib, 0.82 (0.53–0.97). Using serial radiographic measurements, the magnitude of exponential increase in signature features deciphering tumor volume, invasion of tumor boundaries, or tumor spatial heterogeneity was associated with shorter overall survival. Conclusions: Radiomics signatures predicted tumor sensitivity to treatment in patients with NSCLC, offering an approach that could enhance clinical decision-making to continue systemic therapies and forecast overall survival.},

  abstract = {Background Drugs targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 have shown activity in multiple malignancies. Considering their novel mechanism of action, whether traditional prognostic scores also apply to patients treated with these drugs is unknown. We investigated whether a baseline 3-point (pt) computed tomography (CT) scan (PS3-CT) score and a 7-pt prognostic (PS7) score allowed identifying long-term survivors on anti-PD-1/-L1 therapy. Materials and methods We reviewed 251 consecutive patients enrolled in phase I trials evaluating anti-PD-1/-L1 agents between 26th December 2011 and 7th September 2015. PS3-CT was calculated using high tumour burden (TB1D-RECIST \&gt; 9 cm), low skeletal muscle index (SMI \&lt; 53 cm2 m−2) and non-pulmonary visceral metastases (NPVM) (1 pt each). PS7 was calculated by adding lower performance status, decreased serum albumin, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase and more than two distant metastases (1 pt each). Effect on overall survival (OS) of each parameter was tested using Kaplan–Meier and multivariable Cox analyses. Results PS3-CT was a significant independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39 [95\% confidence interval CI = 1.07–1.81], p = 0.01) when compared to the Royal Marsden Hospital, Barbot and American Joint Committee on Cancer scores. High TB (n = 78), low SMI (n = 55) and NPVM (n = 146) were associated with poorer survival (p \&lt; 0.01). High TB and low SMI were independent predictors of OS (respective HR of death: 2.00 [95\% CI = 1.38–2.88], p \&lt; 0.01 and 1.75 [95\% CI = 1.15–2.66], p \&lt; 0.01). PS7 was a significant predictor of OS (HR = 1.40 [95\% CI = 1.25–1.56], p \&lt; 0.01). Conclusion Objective and rapid-risk scoring based on three CT scan parameters allows identifying patients with prolonged OS on anti-PD-1/-L1 therapy, independently from conventional clinical–biological prognostic scores. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {For many years, lung cancer was a relatively neglected disease, shrouded in pessimism and with little research funding. However, many advances have occurred, and it is now a vibrant field with a rapid pace of new information. The explosion of literature makes it difficult for anyone to stay current. With more insight comes the identification of many nuances that are important to correctly understand new studies and choose the optimal treatments for patients. Lung cancer has evolved to where it takes a team of individuals, each with lung cancer expertise within their specialty, to be able to provide the necessary up-to-date knowledge base. The crucial aspect here is not to simply have multiple specialties but to develop a forum for ongoing interaction, so that the individuals think and function as a team, making decisions collectively. Such integration and collaboration allow collective knowledge and judgment to be brought to bear on caring for patients. Even for such a team, however, staying abreast of advances is challenging.},

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in MEDLINE and Embase between 01/01/2019 and 05/09/2019, for studies developing a prognostic prediction model using machine learning methods in oncology. We used the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement, Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) and CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) to assess the methodological conduct of included publications. Results were summarised by modelling type: regression-, non-regression-based and ensemble machine learning models. RESULTS: Sixty-two publications met inclusion criteria developing 152 models across all publications. Forty-two models were regression-based, 71 were non-regression-based and 39 were ensemble models. A median of 647 individuals (IQR: 203 to 4059) and 195 events (IQR: 38 to 1269) were used for model development, and 553 individuals (IQR: 69 to 3069) and 50 events (IQR: 17.5 to 326.5) for model validation. A higher number of events per predictor was used for developing regression-based models (median: 8, IQR: 7.1 to 23.5), compared to alternative machine learning (median: 3.4, IQR: 1.1 to 19.1) and ensemble models (median: 1.7, IQR: 1.1 to 6). Sample size was rarely justified (n\,=\,5/62; 8\%). Some or all continuous predictors were categorised before modelling in 24 studies (39\%). 46\% (n\,=\,24/62) of models reporting predictor selection before modelling used univariable analyses, and common method across all modelling types. Ten out of 24 models for time-to-event outcomes accounted for censoring (42\%). A split sample approach was the most popular method for internal validation (n\,=\,25/62, 40\%). Calibration was reported in 11 studies. Less than half of models were reported or made available. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological conduct of machine learning based clinical prediction models is poor. Guidance is urgently needed, with increased awareness and education of minimum prediction modelling standards. Particular focus is needed on sample size estimation, development and validation analysis methods, and ensuring the model is available for independent validation, to improve quality of machine learning based clinical prediction models.},

  abstract = {Vasoconstrictor intensities of renal sympathetic nerve stimulation elevate the renal arterial pressure threshold for steady-state stepwise autoregulation of renal blood flow. This study examined the tonic effect of basal renal sympathetic nerve activity on dynamic autoregulation of renal blood flow in rats with normal (Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Kyoto) and increased levels of renal sympathetic nerve activity (congestive heart failure and spontaneously hypertensive rats). Steady-state values of arterial pressure and renal blood flow before and after acute renal denervation were subjected to transfer function analysis. Renal denervation increased basal renal blood flow in congestive heart failure (+35 +/- 3\%) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (+21 +/- 3\%) but not in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Renal denervation significantly decreased transfer function gain (i.e., improved autoregulation of renal blood flow) and increased coherence only in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Thus vasoconstrictor intensities of renal sympathetic nerve activity impaired the dynamic autoregulatory adjustments of the renal vasculature to oscillations in arterial pressure. Renal denervation increased renal blood flow variability in spontaneously hypertensive rats and congestive heart failure rats. The contribution of vasoconstrictor intensities of basal renal sympathetic nerve activity to limiting renal blood flow variability may be important in the stabilization of glomerular filtration rate.}

  abstract = {Increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity regulate the functions of the nephron, the vasculature, and the renin-containing juxtaglomerular granular cells. Because increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system can also influence nephron and vascular function, it is important to understand the interactions between the renal sympathetic nerves and the renin-angiotensin system in the control of renal function. These interactions can be intrarenal, for example, the direct (by specific innervation) and indirect (by angiotensin II) contributions of increased renal sympathetic nerve activity to the regulation of renal function. The effects of increased renal sympathetic nerve activity on renal function are attenuated when the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed or antagonized with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II-type AT(1)-receptor antagonists. The effects of intrarenal administration of angiotensin II are attenuated after renal denervation. These interactions can also be extrarenal, for example, in the central nervous system, wherein renal sympathetic nerve activity and its arterial baroreflex control are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to the circumventricular organs, whose permeable blood-brain barrier permits interactions with circulating angiotensin II, there are interactions at sites behind the blood-brain barrier that depend on the influence of local angiotensin II. The responses to central administration of angiotensin II-type AT(1)-receptor antagonists into the ventricular system or microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system produced by physiological changes in dietary sodium intake. Similar modulation is observed in pathophysiological models wherein activity of both the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems is increased (eg, congestive heart failure). Thus, both renal and extrarenal sites of interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and renal sympathetic nerve activity are involved in influencing the neural control of renal function.}

Renal denervation was confirmed in every rat at the end of the study by absence of renal vasoconstriction to splanchnic nerve stimulation and loss of renal tissue norepinephrine content. Daily sodium balance, defined as the difference between dietary sodium intake and urinary sodium excretion, was positive with the normal sodium diet before and after bilateral renal denervation. Prior to bilateral renal denervation, changing to the low sodium diet was associated with a diminishingly negative sodium balance for 3 days that became progressively positive thereafter. After bilateral renal denervation, changing to the low sodium diet was associated with a continuous and progressively negative sodium balance. We conclude that intact renal innervation is required for normal renal sodium conservation and maintenance of body sodium balance during dietary sodium restriction.},

  abstract = {Long-term control of arterial pressure has been attributed to the kidney by virtue of its ability to couple the regulation of blood volume to the maintenance of sodium and water balance by the mechanisms of pressure natriuresis and diuresis. In the presence of a defect in renal excretory function, hypertension arises as the consequence of the need for an increase in arterial pressure to offset the abnormal pressure natriuresis and diuresis mechanisms, and to maintain sodium and water balance. There is growing evidence that an important cause of the defect in renal excretory function in hypertension is an increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). First, increased RSNA is found in animal models of hypertension and hypertensive humans. Second, renal denervation prevents or alleviates hypertension in virtually all animal models of hypertension. Finally, increased RSNA results in reduced renal excretory function by virtue of effects on the renal vasculature, the tubules, and the juxtaglomerular granular cells. The increase in RSNA is of central nervous system origin, with one of the stimuli being the action of angiotensin II, probably of central origin. By acting on brain stem nuclei that are important in the control of peripheral sympathetic vasomotor tone (e.g. rostral ventrolateral medulla), angiotensin II increases the basal level of RSNA and impairs its arterial baroreflex regulation. Therefore, the renal sympathetic nerves may serve as the link between central sympathetic nervous system regulatory sites and the kidney in contributing to the renal excretory defect in the development of hypertension.}

The accumulated evidence is compelling for a primary role of the renal innervation in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

  abstract = {The accuracy of a prediction algorithm depends on contextual factors that may vary across deployment settings. To address this inherent limitation of prediction, we propose an approach to counterfactual prediction based on the g-formula to predict risk across populations that differ in their distribution of treatment strategies. We apply this to predict 5-year risk of mortality among persons receiving care for HIV in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration under different hypothetical treatment strategies. First, we implement a conventional approach to develop a prediction algorithm in the observed data and show how the algorithm may fail when transported to new populations with different treatment strategies. Second, we generate counterfactual data under different treatment strategies and use it to assess the robustness of the original algorithm’s performance to these differences and to develop counterfactual prediction algorithms. We discuss how estimating counterfactual risks under a particular treatment strategy is more challenging than conventional prediction as it requires the same data, methods, and unverifiable assumptions as causal inference. However, this may be required when the alternative assumption of constant treatment patterns across deployment settings is unlikely to hold and new data is not yet available to retrain the algorithm.},

DESIGN: Longitudinal, retrospective, cohort analysis of South Carolina Medicaid claims for the years 1997 through 2002. Followup was 12 months from the index date, defined as the first prescription dispensing date for a study drug. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: South Carolina Medicaid beneficiaries receiving fixed-dose (n=3363) and free-combination (n=713) therapy, including 3016 African Americans and 1060 White patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance was defined as the total days' supply of drug (excluding last prescription fill) divided by the length of followup; healthcare utilization included cost and number of claims associated with ambulatory services, hospital care, and prescription drugs. RESULTS: The cohort (N=4076) was 74.0\% African American; mean age was 62.2 years. Compliance was significantly greater in patients who received fixed-dose therapy than in those who received free-combination therapy (58.6\% vs 48.1\%; P{$<$}.05). The average total cost of care was lower for the fixed-dose group (\$4605) than for the free-combination group (\$8531). African Americans and Whites were equally likely to receive the fixed-dose combination. However, compliance was lower among African American patients than among White patients (55\% vs 61\% respectively; P{$<$}.05). Costs and claims for ambulatory and hospital services were higher for African American patients, whereas drug costs and claims were higher for White patients. CONCLUSION: Fixed-dose amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl was associated with higher compliance rates than was free-combination therapy, independent of race. Lower compliance rates among African American patients may have contributed to the higher healthcare resource use and costs observed. Efforts to enhance medication compliance tailored to African Americans may improve outcomes and reduce costs in this high-risk population.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine survival, local and distant control, toxicity, and prognostic factors in patients with stage III non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). METHODS  AND MATERIALS: Consecutive patients with stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC (N~=~154) staged  with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography were  retrospectively selected (2005-2015). CCRT consisted of daily low-dose cisplatin  (6~mg/m(2)) combined with 24 fractions of 2.75~Gy to a total dose of 66~Gy. RESULTS:  During a median follow-up period of 22~months (range, 1-92~months) the median  overall survival was 36~months. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 79\%  (95\% confidence interval [CI], 73\%-86\%), 61\% (95\% CI, 54\%-70\%), 52\% (95\% CI,  43\%-60\%), and 40\% (95\% CI, 31\%-51\%), respectively. The local relapse-free survival  at 5~years was 55\% (95\% CI, 44\%-69\%). Metastasis-free survival at 5~years was 53\%  (95\% CI, 44\%-65\%). The incidence of severe gastrointestinal disorders (grade 3-5)  was 11\%, among which grade 3 radiation esophagitis was 8.4\%. The incidence of severe  respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (grade 3-5) was 8.4\%, among which  grade 3 radiation pneumonitis was 1.3\%. Predictors of overall survival were lymph  node gross tumor volume (GTV) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.007; 95\% CI, 1.000-1.012) and  sex (HR, 0.500; 95\% CI, 0.320-0.870) in favor of women. Although lymph node GTV was  a predictor of treatment toxicity (HR, 1.010; 95\% CI, 1.000-1.013), tumor GTV was  the predictor for distant metastasis during follow-up (HR, 1.002; 95\% CI,  1.001-1.003). CONCLUSIONS: CCRT with daily low-dose cisplatin for locally advanced  stage III NSCLC resulted in promising overall survival (3-year survival rate of 52\%  and 5-year survival rate of 40\%) with low toxicity. Lymph node GTV, tumor GTV,  and~sex were predictors of overall survival, treatment toxicity, and distant  metastasis.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an intuitive yet rigorous tool to communicate about causal questions in clinical and epidemiologic research and inform study design and statistical analysis. DAGs are constructed to depict prior knowledge about biological and behavioral systems related to specific causal research questions. DAG components portray who receives treatment or experience exposures; mechanisms by which treatments and exposures operate; and other factors that influence the outcome of interest or which persons are included in an analysis. Once assembled, DAGs — via a few simple rules — guide the researcher in identifying whether the causal effect of interest can be identified without bias and, if so, what must be done either in study design or data analysis to achieve this. Specifically, DAGs can identify variables that, if controlled for in the design or analysis phase, are sufficient to eliminate confounding and some forms of selection bias. DAGs also help recognize variables that, if controlled for, bias the analysis (e.g., mediators or factors influenced by both exposure and outcome). Finally, DAGs help researchers recognize insidious sources of bias introduced by selection of individuals into studies or failure to completely observe all individuals until study outcomes are reached. DAGs, however, are not infallible, largely owing to limitations in prior knowledge about the system in question. In such instances, several alternative DAGs are plausible, and researchers should assess whether results differ meaningfully across analyses guided by different DAGs and be forthright about uncertainty. DAGs are powerful tools to guide the conduct of clinical research.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants with stage I-III breast cancer were prospectively included from CANTO (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01993498), collecting longitudinal data at diagnosis (before the initiation of any cancer treatment) and 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 4 (T3) years after diagnosis. The main outcome was severe global fatigue at T2 (score ≥ 40/100, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30). Analyses at T3 were exploratory. Secondary outcomes included physical, emotional, and cognitive fatigue (EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-FA12). Multivariable logistic regression models retained associations with severe fatigue by bootstrapped Augmented Backward Elimination. Validation methods included 10-fold internal cross-validation, overoptimism-corrected area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, and external validation. RESULTS: Among 5,640, 5,000, and 3,400 patients at T1, T2, and T3, respectively, the prevalence of post-treatment severe global fatigue was 35.6\%, 34.0\%, and 31.5\% in the development cohort. Retained risk factors for severe global fatigue at T2 were severe pretreatment fatigue (adjusted odds ratio v no 3.191 [95\% CI, 2.704 to 3.767]); younger age (for 1-year decrement 1.015 [1.009 to 1.022]), higher body mass index (for unit increment 1.025 [1.012 to 1.038]), current smoking behavior (v never 1.552 [1.291 to 1.866]), worse anxiety (v noncase 1.265 [1.073 to 1.492]), insomnia (for unit increment 1.005 [1.003 to 1.007]), and pain at diagnosis (for unit increment 1.014 [1.010 to 1.017]), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.72 to 0.75). Receipt of hormonal therapy was a risk factor for severe fatigue at T3 (v no 1.448 [1.165 to 1.799]). Dimension-specific risk factors included body mass index for physical fatigue and emotional distress for emotional and cognitive fatigue. CONCLUSION: We propose a predictive model to assess fatigue among breast cancer survivors, within a personalized survivorship care framework. This may help clinicians to provide early management interventions or to correct modifiable risk factors and offer more tailored monitoring and education to patients at risk of severe post-treatment fatigue.},

The aim of the present study was to carry out a direct comparison of the prognostic value of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and Body Mass Index/Weight Loss Grade (BMI/WL grade) in patients with advanced cancer. METHOD: All data were collected prospectively across 18 sites in the UK and Ireland. Patient's age, sex, ECOG-PS, mGPS and BMI/WL grade were recorded, as were details of underlying disease including metastases. Survival data were analysed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 730 patients were assessed. The majority of patients were male (53\%), over 65 years of age (56\%), had an ECOG-PS{$>$}0/1 (56\%), mGPS≥1 (56\%), BMI≥25 (51\%), {$<$}2.5\% weight loss (57\%) and had metastatic disease (86\%). On multivariate cox regression analysis ECOG-PS (HR 1.61 95\%CI 1.42-1.83, p~{$<~$}0.001), mGPS (HR 1.53, 95\%CI 1.39-1.69, p~{$<~$}0.001) and BMI/WL grade (HR 1.41, 95\%CI 1.25-1.60, p~{$<~$}0.001) remained independently associated with overall survival. In patients with a BMI/WL grade 0/1 both ECOG and mGPS remained independently associated with overall survival. CONCLUSION: The ECOG/mGPS framework may form the basis of risk stratification of survival in patients with advanced cancer.},

In a retrospective cohort study, 119 patients were included in final analyses. The majority of patients were over 65 (86\%), female (52\%), had a performance status (ECOG-PS) of 0 or 1 (57\%), were at nutritional risk (57\%), were overweight (53\%), had visceral obesity (62\%), had a normal SMI (51\%), had a low SMD (62\%) and were systemically inflammed (mGPS 1/2, 51\%). An elevated TLG was associated with sex (p {$<$} 0.05), TNM stage (p {$<$} 0.001), MUST (p {$<$} 0.01) and mGPS (p {$<$} 0.01). An elevated mGPS was associated with age (p {$<$} 0.05), NLR (p {$<$} 0.01), MUST (p {$<$} 0.01), and TLG (p {$<$} 0.01). On univariate survival analysis, TNM stage (p {$<$} 0.01), mGPS (p {$<$} 0.05), NLR (p {$<$} 0.01), MUST (p ≤ 0.001), Low SMD (p {$<$} 0.05), SUVmax (p ≤ 0.001) and TLG (p {$<$} 0.001) were associated with overall survival. On multivariate survival analysis MUST (HR: 1.49 95\%CI 1.12–01.98 p {$<$} 0.01) and TLG (HR: 2.02 95\%CI 1.34–3.04 p = 0.001) remained independently associated with survival. In conclusion, elevated tumour metabolic activity was associated with more advanced stage, greater nutritional risk, the systemic inflammatory response and poorer survival but not body composition analysis in patients with lung cancer. These results suggest that detrimental body composition is not directly determined by tumour metabolic activity but rather an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Nine sites contributed prospective data on patient demographics, ECOG-PS, mGPS, physical function tests, and CT-derived body composition. Categorical variables were analysed using χ2 test for linear-by-linear association, or χ2 test for 2-by-2 tables. Associations were analysed using binary logistic regression. A total of 523 cancer patients (266 males, 257 females) were included in the final analysis and most had metastatic disease (83.2\%). The median overall survival was 5.6 months. On multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, a high ECOG-PS remained independently associated with a low skeletal muscle index (p {$<$} 0.001), low skeletal muscle density (p {$<$} 0.05), and timed up and go test failure (p {$<$} 0.001). A high mGPS remained independently associated with a low skeletal muscle density (p {$<$} 0.05) and hand grip strength test failure (p {$<$} 0.01).

  abstract = {SummaryBackground Patients who seek treatment in hospitals can introduce high-risk clones of hospital-acquired, antibiotic-resistant pathogens from previous admissions. In this manner, different healthcare institutions become linked epidemiologically. All links combined form the national patient referral network, through which high-risk clones can propagate. Aim To assess the influence of changes in referral patterns and network structure on the dispersal of these pathogens. Methods Hospital admission data were mapped to reconstruct the English patient referral network, and 12 geographically distinct healthcare collectives were identified. The number of patients admitted and referred to hospitals outside their collective was measured. Simulation models were used to assess the influence of changing network structure on the spread of hospital-acquired pathogens. Findings Simulation models showed that decreasing the number of between-collective referrals by redirecting, on average, just 1.5 patients/hospital/day had a strong effect on dispersal. By decreasing the number of between-collective referrals, the spread of high-risk clones through the network can be reduced by 36\%. Conversely, by creating supra-regional specialist centres that provide specialist care at national level, the rate of dispersal can increase by 48\%. Conclusion The structure of the patient referral network has a profound effect on the epidemic behaviour of high-risk clones. Any changes that affect the number of referrals between healthcare collectives, inevitably affect the national dispersal of these pathogens. These effects should be taken into account when creating national specialist centres, which may jeopardize control efforts.},

By increasing the therapeutic time window for treatment of stroke with intravenous alteplase from 3-4.5 h to 9 h, many more patients could be treated. Use of a combination of diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MRI or perfusion CT might improve selection of patients with penumbral tissue. Several phase II trials of alteplase lend strong biological support to the use of this strategy for up to 6 h after stroke. However, the negative results of the phase III Desmoteplase In Acute ischaemic Stroke trial (DIAS-2) with desmoteplase given up to 9 h after stroke suggest that some refinements are needed. For trials of neuroprotection, the concept of freezing the penumbra (ie, preventing further deterioration of the vulnerable tissue) might be a more realistic expectation. Recent advances in penumbral imaging technology should enable a phase III alteplase trial to be done beyond 4.5 h by use of techniques to select patients with penumbral tissue.},

  abstract = {Hypertension represents a major health problem, with an appalling annual toll. Despite the plethora of antihypertensive drugs, hypertension remains resistant in a considerable number of patients, thus creating the need for alternative strategies, including interventional approaches. Recently, renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) using a very elegant, state-of-the-art technique (percutaneous, catheter-based radiofrequency ablation) was shown to be beneficial in patients with resistant hypertension. The pathophysiology of kidney function justifies the use of RSD in the treatment of hypertension. Data from older studies have shown that sympathectomy has efficiently lowered blood pressure and prolonged the life expectancy of patients with hypertension, but at considerable cost. RSD is devoid of the adverse effects of sympathectomy because of its localized nature, is minimally invasive, and provides short procedural and recovery times. In conclusion, this review outlines the pathophysiologic background of RSD, describes the past and the present of this interventional approach, and considers several future potential applications.}

Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a short-term intensive therapeutic exercise programme to improve muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and functional activities, given in the outpatient department (intervention group; n =22), or home-based exercise advice (control group; n=20). Main measures: Parameters of feasibility, preoperative functional capacity and postoperative course. Results: The intensive training programme was feasible, with a high compliance and no adverse events. Respiratory muscle endurance increased in the preoperative period from 259 ± 273 to 404 ± 349 J in the intervention group and differed significantly from that in the control group (350 ± 299 to 305 ± 323 J; P{$<$}0.01). Timed-Up-and-Go, chair rise time, LASA Physical Activity Questionnaire, Physical Work Capacity and Quality of Life (EORTC-C30) did not reveal significant differences between the two groups. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications and length of hospital stay between the two groups. Conclusion: The intensive therapeutic exercise programme was feasible and improved the respiratory function of patients due to undergo elective abdominal surgery compared with home-based exercise advice.},

Design: Single-blind randomized controlled pilot study. Setting: Gelderse Vallei Hospital Ede, the Netherlands. Subjects: Twenty high-risk patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery were randomly assigned to receive preoperative inspiratory muscle training or usual care. Main measures: Effectiveness outcome variables were atelectasis, inspiratory muscle strength and vital capacity, and feasibility outcome variables were adverse effects and patient satisfaction with inspiratory muscle training. Results: Despite randomization, patients in the intervention group were significantly older than the patients in the control group (70 ± 6 years versus 59 ± 6 years, respectively; P = 0.001). Eight patients in the control group and three in the intervention group developed atelectasis (P = 0.07). The median duration of atelectasis was 0 days in the intervention group and 1.5 days in the control group (P = 0.07). No adverse effects of preoperative inspiratory muscle training were observed and patients considered that inspiratory muscle training was a good preparation for surgery. Mean postoperative inspiratory pressure was 10\% higher in the intervention group. Conclusion: Preoperative inspiratory muscle training is well tolerated and appreciated and seems to reduce the incidence of atelectasis in patients scheduled for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery.},

However, many methodological works have raised concerns about the interpretation of hazard ratios as causal effects. These concerns are often related to three points: (i) depletion of susceptible individuals leads to selection bias and complicates the causal interpretation of the hazard ratio, (ii) the hazard ratio is not collapsible, and (iii) the conventional proportional hazards assumption rarely holds in medical studies. We discuss the relation between these three points. We ground our presentation on an example about effect of endocrine therapy in reducing the risk of recurrence or death in a population of patients with breast cancer. We also describe why survival curves and risk differences do not exhibit any of the undesirable properties of hazard ratios.},

Within the SCG, varicose NOS-IR fibers encircled virtually all postganglionic neurons and small diameter cells, presumably small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells. Perikarya of SIF cells exhibited strong NOS-IR, whereas the level appeared to be low in postganglionic neurons. Decentralization of the SCG for 4–6 days markedly reduced the number as well as the intensity of NOS-IR fibers without causing a detectable change of NOS-IR in the postganglionic neurons and SIF cells. Beneath the adrenal capsule, bundles of NOS-IR fibers bifurcated and made a sharp turn to reach the adrenal medulla. Chromaffin cells, which themselves exhibited fairly strong NOS-IR, appeared to be surrounded by NOS-IR fibers. The result shows that NOS-IR is present in pre- and post-synaptic elements of the sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla, representing a complex system that may regulate the activity of ganglionic neurons and chromaffin cells via a number of sites of action.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Moderate differences in efficacy between adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for breast cancer are plausible, and could affect treatment choices. We sought any such differences. METHODS: We undertook individual-patient-data meta-analyses of the randomised trials comparing: any taxane-plus-anthracycline-based regimen versus the same, or more, non-taxane chemotherapy (n=44,000); one anthracycline-based regimen versus another (n=7000) or versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; n=18,000); and polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (n=32,000). The scheduled dosages of these three drugs and of the anthracyclines doxorubicin (A) and epirubicin (E) were used to define standard CMF, standard 4AC, and CAF and CEF. Log-rank breast cancer mortality rate ratios (RRs) are reported. FINDINGS: In trials adding four separate cycles of a taxane to a fixed anthracycline-based control regimen, extending treatment duration, breast cancer mortality was reduced (RR 0·86, SE 0·04, two-sided significance [2p]=0·0005). In trials with four such extra cycles of a taxane counterbalanced in controls by extra cycles of other cytotoxic drugs, roughly doubling non-taxane dosage, there was no significant difference (RR 0·94, SE 0·06, 2p=0·33). Trials with CMF-treated controls showed that standard 4AC and standard CMF were equivalent (RR 0·98, SE 0·05, 2p=0·67), but that anthracycline-based regimens with substantially higher cumulative dosage than standard 4AC (eg, CAF or CEF) were superior to standard CMF (RR 0·78, SE 0·06, 2p=0·0004). Trials versus no chemotherapy also suggested greater mortality reductions with CAF (RR 0·64, SE 0·09, 2p{$<$}0·0001) than with standard 4AC (RR 0·78, SE 0·09, 2p=0·01) or standard CMF (RR 0·76, SE 0·05, 2p{$<$}0·0001). In all meta-analyses involving taxane-based or anthracycline-based regimens, proportional risk reductions were little affected by age, nodal status, tumour diameter or differentiation (moderate or poor; few were well differentiated), oestrogen receptor status, or tamoxifen use. Hence, largely independently of age (up to at least 70 years) or the tumour characteristics currently available to us for the patients selected to be in these trials, some taxane-plus-anthracycline-based or higher-cumulative-dosage anthracycline-based regimens (not requiring stem cells) reduced breast cancer mortality by, on average, about one-third. 10-year overall mortality differences paralleled breast cancer mortality differences, despite taxane, anthracycline, and other toxicities. INTERPRETATION: 10-year gains from a one-third breast cancer mortality reduction depend on absolute risks without chemotherapy (which, for oestrogen-receptor-positive disease, are the risks remaining with appropriate endocrine therapy). Low absolute risk implies low absolute benefit, but information was lacking about tumour gene expression markers or quantitative immunohistochemistry that might help to predict risk, chemosensitivity, or both.

  abstract = {Background There have been many randomised trials of adjuvant tamoxifen among women with early breast cancer, and an updated overview of their results is presented. Methods In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen before recurrence. Information was obtained and analysed centrally on each of 37\hphantom{,}000 women in 55 such trials, comprising about 87\% of the worldwide evidence. Compared with the previous such overview, this approximately doubles the amount of evidence from trials of about 5 years of tamoxifen and, taking all trials together, on events occurring more than 5 years after randomisation. Findings Nearly 8000 of the women had a low, or zero, level of the oestrogen-receptor protein (ER) measured in their primary tumour. Among them, the overall effects of tamoxifen appeared to be small, and subsequent analyses of recurrence and total mortality are restricted to the remaining women (18\hphantom{,}000 with ER-positive tumours, plus nearly 12\hphantom{,}000 more with untested tumours, of which an estimated 8000 would have been ER-positive). For trials of 1 year, 2 years, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced among these 30\hphantom{,}000 women during about 10 years of follow-up were 21\% (SD 3), 29\% (SD 2), and 47\% (SD 3), respectively, with a highly significant trend towards greater effect with longer treatment (χ21=52·0, 2p{$<$}0·00001). The corresponding proportional mortality reductions were 12\% (SD 3), 17\% (SD 3), and 26\% (SD 4), respectively, and again the test for trend was significant (χ21= 8·8, 2p=0·003). The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years, whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years. The proportional mortality reductions were similar for women with node-positive and node-negative disease, but the absolute mortality reductions were greater in node-positive women. In the trials of about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen the absolute improvements in 10-year survival were 10·9\% (SD 2·5) for node-positive (61·4\% vs 50·5\% survival, 2p{$<$}0·00001) and 5·6\% (SD 1·3) for node-negative (78·9\% vs 73·3\% survival, 2p{$<$}0·00001). These benefits appeared to be largely irrespective of age, menopausal status, daily tamoxifen dose (which was generally 20 mg), and of whether chemotherapy had been given to both groups. In terms of other outcomes among all women studied (ie, including those with "ER-poor" tumours), the proportional reductions in contralateral breast cancer were 13\% (SD 13), 26\% (SD 9), and 47\% (SD 9) in the trials of 1, 2, or about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was approximately doubled in trials of 1 or 2 years of tamoxifen and approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen (although the number of cases was small and these ratios were not significantly different from each other). The absolute decrease in contralateral breast cancer was about twice as large as the absolute increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen had no apparent effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer or, after exclusion of deaths from breast or endometrial cancer, on any of the other main categories of cause of death (total nearly 2000 such deaths; overall relative risk 0·99 [SD 0·05]). Interpretation For women with tumours that have been reliably shown to be ER-negative, adjuvant tamoxifen remains a matter for research. However, some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10-year survival of women with ER-positive tumours and of women whose tumours are of unknown ER status, with the proportional reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality appearing to be largely unaffected by other patient characteristics or treatments.},

  abstract = {Primary headaches such as migraine are postulated to involve the activation of sensory trigeminal pain neurons that innervate intracranial blood vessels and the dura mater. It is suggested that local activation of these sensory nerves may involve dural mast cells as one factor in local inflammation, causing sensitization of meningeal nociceptors. Immunofluorescence was used to study the~detailed distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor components calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) in whole-mount rat dura mater and in human dural vessels. The relative distributions of CGRP, CLR, and RAMP1 were evaluated with respect to each other and in relationship to mast cells, myelin, substance P, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. CGRP expression was found in thin unmyelinated fibers, whereas CLR and RAMP1 were expressed in thicker myelinated fibers coexpressed with an A-fiber marker. CLR and RAMP1 immunoreactivity colocalized with mast cell tryptase in rodent; however, expression of both receptor components was not observed in human mast cells. Immunoreactive substance P fibers coexpressed CGRP, although neuronal nitric oxide synthase and vasoactive intestinal peptide expression was very limited, and these fibers were distinct from the CGRP-positive fibers. Few pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide immunoreactive fibers occurred and some colocalized with CGRP. PERSPECTIVE: This study demonstrates the detailed distribution of CGRP and its receptor in the dura mater. These data suggest that CGRP is expressed in C-fibers and may act on A-fibers, rodent mast cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells that express the CGRP receptor. These sites represent potential pathophysiological targets of novel antimigraine agents such as the newly developed CGRP receptor antagonists.},

METHODS: In a retrospective survey in 9 cancer centers of the German Cancer Society, 692 patients were identified with BM-MM during the period 1986 through 2007. Overall survival was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier estimator and compared with log-rank analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify prognostic factors significant for survival. RESULTS: The median overall survival of the entire cohort was 5.0 months (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 4 months-5 months). Significant prognostic factors in the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis were Karnofsky performance status (≥70\% vs {$<$}70\%; P {$<$} .001), number of BM-MM (single vs multiple; P {$<$} .001), pretreatment levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal vs elevated; P {$<$} .001) and S-100 (normal vs elevated; P {$<$} .001), prognostic groups according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (class I vs class II vs class III; P = .0485), and treatment choice (for the cohort with single BM-MM only) (stereotactic radiotherapy or neurosurgical metastasectomy vs others; P = .036). Cox proportional hazards models revealed pretreatment elevated level of serum LDH (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.0 [P = .00013]) and number of BM-MM (HR, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.3-2.0 [P = .00011]) to be independent prognostic variables in the entire cohort, whereas in patients with a single BM-MM, treatment choice (HR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.9 [P = .0061]) was identified as a unique prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival of patients with BM-MM primarily depends on the number of metastases and pretreatment level of LDH. In the case of a single brain metastasis, stereotactic radiotherapy or neurosurgical metastasectomy is by far the most important factor for improving survival.

We have audited the changes in treatment practice for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) presented to a single multidisciplinary team (MDT) at Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals between January 1998 and December 2005.               Materials and Methods               . The MDT database was used to identify all patients with SCLC. Anonymised demographic, treatment, and outcome details were extracted from the database supplemented by patient records.               Results               . 235 patients were identified. 112 (48\%) had limited disease at presentation. Chemotherapy was the initial treatment for 195 patients, 77\% of whom had a documented radiological response with a complete response in 24\%. Chemotherapy regimes evolved during the study period with the increasing use of platinum-based chemotherapy. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy was most used before 2004 and was given to 57\% of all patients. 42\% received consolidation thoracic radiotherapy and 24\% prophylactic cranial irradiation. The median and 2-year survival were 8 months and 18\%, respectively, for patients with limited disease and 5 months and 5\%, respectively, for extensive disease.               Conclusion               . We have documented changes in treatment practice and service delivery of SCLC over the 8 years during which the MDT has been operating.

The purpose of this study was to investigate tumor volume reduction  ratio (VRR) and its correlation with outcomes in a cohort of patients with stage III  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent image-guided radiochemotherapy  (RCTx). MATERIALS/METHODS: Fifty patients with NSCLC treated with fractionated RT at  our institution between 2013 and 2017 were included. The relationship between gross  tumor volume (GTV) changes during RT (week 1 vs. week 5) and outcomes were  evaluated. RESULTS: The median radiation dose delivered was 59.4~Gy (median fraction  dose, 1.8~Gy). The median GTV before treatment was 119~cm(3), with a median GTV  change of -\,40\%. Patients with more volume reduction had poorer tumor control. A  VRR\,{$>$}\,40\% was associated with a poorer OS and PFS in patients with  non-adenocarcinoma (non-ADC) histology. In multivariate analysis, VRR during RT, and  chemotherapy (CTx) administration remained related to PFS and OS, while initial GTV  remained a significant determinant for OS. In subgroup analyses, and CTx (p\,=\,0.038)  affected PFS among non-ADC patients, with initial GTV (p\,=\,0.058) and VRR (p\,=\,0.08)  showing non-significant trends. Initial GTV (p\,=\,0.023), VRR (p\,=\,0.038), and CTx  (p\,=\,0.01) remained significant predictors for OS in the non-ADC group. CONCLUSION:  Worse tumor control and OS in non-ADC patients are observed with more marked  RT-induced tumor shrinkage, supporting the development of response-adaptive  treatment strategies, particularly in non-ADC NSCLC patients.},

  abstract = {Current progress in artificial intelligence is centered around so-called large language models that consist of neural networks processing long sequences of high-dimensional vectors called tokens. Statistical physics provides powerful tools to study the functioning of learning with neural networks and has played a recognized role in the development of modern machine learning. The statistical physics approach relies on simplified and analytically tractable models of data. However, simple tractable models for long sequences of high-dimensional tokens are largely underexplored. Inspired by the crucial role models such as the single-layer teacher-student perceptron (aka generalized linear regression) played in the theory of fully connected neural networks, in this paper, we introduce and study the bilinear sequence regression (BSR) as one of the most basic models for sequences of tokens. We note that modern architectures naturally subsume the BSR model due to the skip connections. Building on recent methodological progress, we compute the Bayes-optimal generalization error for the model in the limit of long sequences of high-dimensional tokens, and provide a message-passing algorithm that matches this performance. We quantify the improvement that optimal learning brings with respect to vectorizing the sequence of tokens and learning via simple linear regression. We also unveil surprising properties of the gradient descent algorithms in the BSR model.},

  abstract = {1. In searching for biological evidence that essential hypertension is caused by chronic mental stress, a disputed proposition, parallels are noted with panic disorder, which provides an explicit clinical model of recurring stress responses. 2. There is clinical comorbidity; panic disorder prevalence is increased threefold in essential hypertension. Plasma cortisol is elevated in both. 3. In panic disorder and essential hypertension, but not in health, single sympathetic nerve fibres commonly fire repeatedly within an individual cardiac cycle; this appears to be a signature of stress exposure. For both conditions, adrenaline cotransmission is present in sympathetic nerves. 4. Tissue nerve growth factor is increased in both (nerve growth factor is a stress reactant). There is induction of the adrenaline synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase, in sympathetic nerves, an explicit indicator of mental stress exposure. 5. The question of whether chronic mental stress causes high blood pressure, still hotly debated, has been reviewed by an Australian Government body, the Specialist Medical Review Council. Despite the challenging medicolegal implications, the Council determined that stress is one proven cause of hypertension, this ruling being published in the 27 March 2002 Australian Government Gazette. This judgement was reached after consideration of the epidemiological evidence, but in particular after review of the specific elements of the neural pathophysiology of essential hypertension, described above.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the importance of CT-defined total tumor volume (TTV) on overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable or medically inoperable  non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1991 and 1998,  150 evaluable patients with Stage I-IIIB NSCLC were treated with three-dimensionally  planned conformal radiotherapy and curative intent at Duke University Medical  Center. On the treatment-planning CT, the primary tumor and nodal volumes were  identified and subsequently combined to form the TTV. The TTV was compared with the  stage and outcome with respect to OS, local progression-free survival, and distant  failure-free survival using the Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance and  Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. To account for the potentially confounding effects of  therapeutic and patient-specific covariates on survival, the Cox proportional hazard  regression model was used. RESULTS: The TTVs in patients with Stage I disease  (median 19 cm3) were smaller than in patients with Stage II (median 80 cm3) or Stage  III (median 97 cm3; p {$<$}0.001) disease. The Stage II TTVs were not significantly  different from those of Stage III (post-hoc test according to Bonferroni). Prolonged  OS was independently associated with a small TTV ({$<$}80 vs. {$>$}80 cm3 [median]; p =  0.01), young age ({$<$}60 vs. {$>$} or =60 years; p = 0.03), high Karnofsky performance  status ({$<$} o r =70 vs. {$>$}70; p = 0.04), and female gender (p = 0.04). Both stage (p =  0.7) and T stage (p = 0.06) were of less importance for OS than was the TTV,  according to multivariate modeling. Increased local progression-free survival (p =  0.001) and distant failure-free survival (p = 0.03) were independently associated  with a small TTV (i.e., {$<$}80 cm3). The results were unchanged if the TTV was analyzed  as a continuous variable. CONCLUSION: A strong independent association between a  small CT-defined TTV and prolonged survival in patients with NSCLC selected for  curative/definitive RT was found. Future therapeutic studies in NSCLC should  consider stratifying/adjusting for differences in TTV to avoid confounding effects  on survival from variations in the TTV at baseline.},

  abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the predictive role of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of response to immunotherapy in patients affected by metastatic lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a single-center database, data for 32 patients (median age: 69 years; range: 37-78) with metastatic lung cancer were retrospectively retrieved. All patients were treated with nivolumab. PD-L1 expression was available in 19/32 patients. All patients underwent F-FDG PET/CT before immunotherapy. Whole-body maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmaxwb), metabolic tumor volume (MTVwb), and total lesion glycolysis (TLGwb) were obtained as the sum of SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis in all metabolic lesions. The best response to therapy was considered in terms of partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) on the basis of clinical and radiological follow-up. RESULTS: F-FDG PET/CT was positive in 30/32 (94\%) patients. The majority of them had a pathological F-FDG uptake in the lung, lymph nodes, and bones. SUVmaxwb, MTVwb, and TLGwb were higher in patients with a positive PD-L1 expression than those with negative expression. Twenty-one patients achieved disease control (PR+SD), whereas 11 did not (PD). SUVmaxwb was significantly higher in patients without a response to therapy than those with a response to immunotherapy (median: 48.97 vs. 20.85; Student t-test: P = 0.002). Similarly, TLGwb and MTVwb were also higher in nonresponders than responders, although not statistically significant. However, the difference was more evident in women than men (median SUVmaxwb in responders and nonresponders for women and men: 17.86 vs. 85.89 and 21.38 vs. 44.38, respectively). CONCLUSION: The entire tumor burden evaluated by F-FDG PET/CT can be predictive of response to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic lung cancer. A large prospective multicenter trial is warranted to definitively assess the usefulness of F-FDG PET/CT as a predictive biomarker of response to immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {Introduction In the Phase 3, placebo-controlled PACIFIC trial of patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC without disease progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, consolidative durvalumab was associated with significant improvements in the primary end points of overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR]~= 0.68; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53–0.87; p~= 0.00251; data cutoff, March 22, 2018) and progression-free survival (PFS) (blinded independent central review; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) (HR~= 0.52; 95\% CI: 0.42–65; p {$<$} 0.0001; February 13, 2017) with manageable safety. Here, we report updated analyses of OS and PFS, approximately 4 years after the last patient was randomized. Methods Patients with WHO performance status of 0 or 1 (and any tumor programmed death-ligand 1 status) were randomized (2:1) to intravenous durvalumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo, administered every 2 weeks (≤12 months), stratified by age, sex, and smoking history. OS and PFS were analyzed using a stratified log-rank test in the intent-to-treat population. Medians and 4-year OS and PFS rates were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Results Overall, 709 of 713 randomized patients received durvalumab (n/N=473/476) or placebo (n/N=236/237). As of March 20, 2020 (median follow-up~= 34.2 months; range: 0.2–64.9), updated OS (HR~= 0.71; 95\% CI: 0.57–0.88) and PFS (HR~= 0.55; 95\% CI: 0.44–0.67) remained consistent with the primary analyses. The median OS for durvalumab was reached (47.5 mo; placebo, 29.1 months). Estimated 4-year OS rates were 49.6\% versus 36.3\% for durvalumab versus placebo, and 4-year PFS rates were 35.3\% versus 19.5\% respectively. Conclusion These updated exploratory analyses demonstrate durable PFS and sustained OS benefit with durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy. An estimated 49.6\% of patients randomized to durvalumab remain alive at 4 years (placebo, 36.3\%), and 35.3\% remain alive and progression-free (placebo, 19.5\%).},

Selecting the best model for a new setting without available data is challenging. We aimed to investigate the transportability by calibration and discrimination of prediction models for cognitive impairment in simulated external settings with different distributions of demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods\enspace{} We mapped and quantified relationships between variables associated with cognitive impairment using causal graphs, structural equation models, and data from the ADNI study. These estimates were then used to generate datasets and evaluate prediction models with different sets of predictors. We measured transportability to external settings under guided interventions on age, APOE ε4, and tau-protein, using performance differences between internal and external settings measured by calibration metrics and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Results\enspace{} Calibration differences indicated that models predicting with causes of the outcome were more transportable than those predicting with consequences. AUC differences indicated inconsistent trends of transportability between the different external settings. Models predicting with consequences tended to show higher AUC in the external settings compared to internal settings, while models predicting with parents or all variables showed similar AUC. Conclusions\enspace{} We demonstrated with a practical prediction task example that predicting with causes of the outcome results in better transportability compared to anti-causal predictions when considering calibration differences. We conclude that calibration performance is crucial when assessing model transportability to external settings.},

DESIGN: A secondary analysis of subset data from two prospective observational cohort studies. SETTING: A university based in-person and online NFP service program. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty couples who used either a website or an in-person NFP service to learn how to avoid pregnancy from January 2001 to November 2012. METHODS: A prospective 12-month effectiveness study among 160 women (between ages 40-55) who used NFP to avoid pregnancy. The women used either a hormonal fertility monitor, cervical mucus monitoring, or both to estimate the fertile phase of their menstrual cycles. Survival analysis was used to determine the pregnancy rate over 12~months of use. RESULTS: There were a total of five unintended pregnancies among the participants. The typical use pregnancy rate was six~per 100 women over 12~months. The monitor alone participants (n~=~35) had a 12-month pregnancy rate of three, the participants (n~=~73) who used mucus alone had a pregnancy rate of four, and the participants (n~=~42) who used the fertility monitor plus mucus had a pregnancy rate of six. CONCLUSION: Natural family planning methods can be effective for older women to avoid an unintended pregnancy with correct use and adequate instructions. The pregnancy rate most likely was affected by diminished fertility and motivation to limit family size.},

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an online taught NFP method, 358 women and (their male partners) indicated "how much" and "how hard" they wished to avoid pregnancy on a scale of 0 to 10 before each menstrual cycle charted over 12 month of use. This motivation scale is used in the National Survey of Family Growth as a measure of motivation. All pregnancies were verified with an online pregnancy evaluation and urine-based pregnancy test. A combined motivation score was used in analysis. RESULTS: There were 28 pregnancies among the low-motivation participants (N = 60) and 16 among the high-motivation participants (N = 298). At 12 months of use, there were 75 pregnancies per 100 users for the low-motivation group and only 8 for the high-motivation group. There was an 80\% greater likelihood of a pregnancy with the low-motivation group (χ = 25.5, p {$<$} .001, odds ratio = 1.80; 95\% confidence interval = 1.61-1.90). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: High motivation to avoid pregnancy by both the female user of a behavioral method of family planning and her male partner is required for high efficacy. Assessing motivation of both the woman and her male partner before prescribing NFP methods is recommended.},

STUDY DESIGN: Six hundred and sixty-seven women and their male partners were randomized into either an electronic hormonal fertility monitor (EHFM) group or a cervical mucus monitoring (CMM) group. Both groups utilized a Web site with instructions, charts and support. Acceptability was assessed online at 1, 3 and 6 months. Pregnancy rates were determined by survival analysis. RESULTS: The EHFM participants (N=197) had a total pregnancy rate of 7 per 100 users over 12 months of use compared with 18.5 for the CMM group (N=164). The log rank survival test showed a significant difference (p{$<$}.01) in survival functions. Mean acceptability for both groups increased significantly over time (p{$<$}.0001). Continuation rates at 12 months were 40.6\% for the monitor group and 36.6\% for the mucus group. CONCLUSION: In comparison with the CMM, the EHFM method of family planning was more effective. All users had an increase in acceptability over time. Results are tempered by the high dropout rate.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms can often differ in performance across domains. Understanding \$\textbackslash textit\{why\}\$ their performance differs is crucial for determining what types of interventions (e.g., algorithmic or operational) are most effective at closing the performance gaps. Existing methods focus on \$\textbackslash textit\{aggregate decompositions\}\$ of the total performance gap into the impact of a shift in the distribution of features \$p(X)\$ versus the impact of a shift in the conditional distribution of the outcome \$p(Y|X)\$; however, such coarse explanations offer only a few options for how one can close the performance gap. \$\textbackslash textit\{Detailed variable-level decompositions\}\$ that quantify the importance of each variable to each term in the aggregate decomposition can provide a much deeper understanding and suggest much more targeted interventions. However, existing methods assume knowledge of the full causal graph or make strong parametric assumptions. We introduce a nonparametric hierarchical framework that provides both aggregate and detailed decompositions for explaining why the performance of an ML algorithm differs across domains, without requiring causal knowledge. We derive debiased, computationally-efficient estimators, and statistical inference procedures for asymptotically valid confidence intervals.},

  abstract = {Performance monitoring of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction models in healthcare is complicated by the issue of performativity: when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict. A simple approach is to ignore performativity and monitor only the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain unaltered. In general, ignoring performativity may inflate Type I error because (i) untreated patients disproportionally represent those with low predicted risk, and (ii) changes in the clinician’s trust in the ML algorithm and the algorithm itself can induce complex dependencies that violate standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we show that valid inference is still possible when monitoring \textbackslash textit\{conditional\} rather than marginal performance measures under either the assumption of conditional exchangeability or time-constant selection bias. Finally, performativity can vary over time and induce nonstationarity in the data, which presents challenges for monitoring. To this end, we introduce a new score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) monitoring procedure with dynamic control limits. Through extensive simulation studies, we study applications of the score-based CUSUM and how it is affected by various factors, including the efficiency of model updating procedures and the level of clinician trust. Finally, we apply the procedure to detect calibration decay of a risk model during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are popular tools for identifying appropriate adjustment strategies for epidemiological analysis. However, a lack of direction on how to build them is problematic. As a solution, we propose using a combination of evidence synthesis strategies and causal inference principles to integrate the DAG-building exercise within the review stages of research projects. We demonstrate this idea by introducing a novel protocol: ‘Evidence Synthesis for Constructing Directed Acyclic Graphs’ (ESC-DAGs)’.ESC-DAGs operates on empirical studies identified by a literature search, ideally a novel systematic review or review of systematic reviews. It involves three key stages: (i) the conclusions of each study are ‘mapped’ into a DAG; (ii) the causal structures in these DAGs are systematically assessed using several causal inference principles and are corrected accordingly; (iii) the resulting DAGs are then synthesised into one or more ‘integrated DAGs’. This demonstration article didactically applies ESC-DAGs to the literature on parental influences on offspring alcohol use during adolescence.ESC-DAGs is a practical, systematic and transparent approach for developing DAGs from background knowledge. These DAGs can then direct primary data analysis and DAG-based sensitivity analysis. ESC-DAGs has a modular design to allow researchers who are experienced DAG users to both use and improve upon the approach. It is also accessible to researchers with limited experience of DAGs or evidence synthesis.}

A similar distribution of sympathetic neurons projected to the right kidney, with most cells in T12 and T13 paravertebral ganglia. Only 20\% of the total sympathetic supply to either kidney arose from the prevertebral ganglia. The renal sensory innervation was also bilateral in origin, with about 80\% of the neurons arising from ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia. Injection of HRP into the caudal and rostral poles of the left kidney labeled paravertebral neurons which were concentrated in ganglia L1 and T13, respectively, but did not label any sensory neurons. We conclude that most of the renal sympathetic innervation is paravertebral in origin, and that a substantial bilateral component exists for both sympathetic and sensory supplies. Neurons arising from the contralateral side have their cell bodies in segments that provide the main ipsilateral innervation to the same kidney. The majority of sensory axons appear to be restricted to subcortical areas.},

  abstract = {Causal decision making (CDM) at scale has become a routine part of business, and increasingly, CDM is based on statistical models and machine learning algorithms. Businesses algorithmically target offers, incentives, and recommendations to affect consumer behavior. Recently, we have seen an acceleration of research related to CDM and causal effect estimation (CEE) using machine-learned models. This article highlights an important perspective: CDM is not the same as CEE, and counterintuitively, accurate CEE is not necessary for accurate CDM. Our experience is that this is not well understood by practitioners or most researchers. Technically, the estimand of interest is different, and this has important implications both for modeling and for the use of statistical models for CDM. We draw on recent research to highlight three implications. (1) We should carefully consider the objective function of the causal machine learning, and if possible, optimize for accurate “treatment assignment” rather than for accurate effect-size estimation. (2) Confounding affects CDM and CEE differently. The upshot here is that for supporting CDM it may be just as good or even better to learn with confounded data as with unconfounded data. (3) Causal statistical modeling may not be necessary at all to support CDM because a proxy target for statistical modeling might do as well or better. This third observation helps to explain at least one broad common CDM practice that seems “wrong” at first blush—the widespread use of noncausal models for targeting interventions. The last two implications are particularly important in practice, as acquiring (unconfounded) data on both “sides” of the counterfactual for modeling can be quite costly and often impracticable. These observations open substantial research ground. We hope to facilitate research in this area by pointing to related articles from multiple contributing fields, most of them written in the last five years.},

  abstract = {Causal machine learning (ML) offers flexible, data-driven methods for predicting treatment outcomes including efficacy and toxicity, thereby supporting the assessment and safety of drugs. A key benefit of causal ML is that it allows for estimating individualized treatment effects, so that clinical decision-making can be personalized to individual patient profiles. Causal ML can be used in combination with both clinical trial data and real-world data, such as clinical registries and electronic health records, but caution is needed to avoid biased or incorrect predictions. In this Perspective, we discuss the benefits of causal ML (relative to traditional statistical or ML approaches) and outline the key components and steps. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of causal ML and effective translation into the clinic.},

Stephen Paget's 1889 proposal that metastasis depends on cross-talk between selected cancer cells (the 'seeds') and specific organ microenvironments (the 'soil') still holds forth today. It is now known that the potential of a tumour cell to metastasize depends on its interactions with the homeostatic factors that promote tumour-cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. How has this field developed over the past century, and what major breakthroughs are most likely to lead to effective therapeutic approaches?},

  abstract = {The development of a metastasis is dependent on an interplay between host factors and intrinsic characteristics of malignant tumor cells. The process of metastasis is highly selective, and the metastatic lesion represents the end point of many destructive events that only a few cells can survive. Neoplasms, which are predominantly heterogeneous, contain a variety of subpopulations of cells with differing metastatic potential. Furthermore, metastatic cell variants have been shown to preexist in murine neoplasms of old and recent origin. The possible existence of highly metastatic variant cells within a primary tumor suggests that we no longer should consider a neoplasm to be a uniform entity. Efforts to design effective therapeutic agents and procedures against malignant tumors should be directed toward the few but fatal metastatic subpopulations of cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Infarct volume may predict clinical outcome in acute stroke, but manual segmentation techniques limit its routine use. We hypothesized that computer-assisted volumetric analysis to quantify acute infarct volume will show no difference compared with manual segmentation but will show increased speed of performance and will correlate with outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with acute stroke younger than 18 years were included. Infarct volume on diffusion-weighted imaging was quantified by using computer-assisted volumetric and manual techniques. The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure scored clinical outcome. Computer-assisted volumetric and manual techniques were compared with correlation coefficients. Linear regression analysis compared Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure with core infarct volume and percentage volume of brain infarction. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were analyzed (mean age, 4.6 years). Mean infarct volume from computer-assisted volumetric and manual approaches was 65.6 and 63.7 mL, respectively (P = .56). Concordance correlation between methods was 0.980, and between users, 0.968. The mean times for segmentation between computer-assisted volumetric and manual techniques were {$<$}1 minute and 7.3 minutes (P {$<$} .001). The mean infarct volumes for good and poor outcome groups were 7.4 and 75.7 mL (P {$<$} .007). The mean percentages of infarcted brain parenchyma for good and poor outcome groups were 0.6\% and 10.4\% (P {$<$} .006). Volumes of 32 mL and 3\% for infarcted brain were associated with poor outcome in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-assisted volumetric quantification of infarct volume is reproducible, is significantly faster than manual techniques, and may have important applications for future clinical workflow. Core infarct volumes and infarct percentage correlated with outcome severity.},

  abstract = {In chronic renal disease, the addition of a fixed quantity of Na to the extracellular fluid (ECF) will evoke a natriuretic response per nephron which is inversely proportional to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). One factor that could contribute to this "magnification" phenomenon is an increased sensitivity of residual nephrons to physiologic natriuretic forces. The present studies were designed to examine this possibility. Natriuretic urine fractions from uremic patients, infused into one renal artery of normal rats, produced a small but significant unilateral natriuresis. Infusion of the same fractions in identical amount into remnant kidneys of stage II nonuremic rats (i.e., rats with a contralateral normal kidney in situ) produced a natriuresis in the remnant kidney only which was equivalent to that observed in the normal kidneys. The i.v. infusion of natriuretic fractions into stage II rats produced comparable increments in the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) bilaterally. However, when the natriuretic fractions were infused into remnant kidneys of stage III rats (no contralateral kidney), deltaFENa was significantly greater than in the foregoing groups. Because stage III rats have increased control values for FENa, baseline FENa was increased to an equivalent level in normal rats by unilateral renal denervation. Natriuretic factor was administered into the ipsilateral renal artery. Although the natriuretic response was increased, it was significantly less than in the stage III remnant kidneys. The data support the view that the uremic state per se is associated with an enhanced responsiveness of the residual nephrons to the natriuretic factor found in the urine (and blood) of uremic patients.}

  abstract = {Increased sympathetic nervous system activity in the kidney has been postulated as a possible etiologic factor in some forms of hypertension. The present investigation sought to document the possibility of a chronic increase in neurogenic renal vasoconstriction in an experimental model in which increased nervous activity would be expected–neurogenic hypertension resulting from partial baroreceptor deafferentation. In anesthetized rats with chronic neurogenic hypertension, renal vascular resistance was significantly higher than in sham-operated rats. After acute renal denervation, there was no statistically significant difference in renal vascular resistance between the two groups. Thus, a chronic increase in neurogenic renal vascular resistance was apparent in the hypertensive rats. Since renal vascular responses to direct renal nerve activation, norepinephrine, and other exogenous vasoactive hormones were not altered in the hypertensive rats, the increased neurogenic vasoconstriction was probably the result of increased renal nerve discharge. Unaltered neurotransmission and reactivity further indicated a failure of the renal nerves or blood vessels to "adapt" to increased nervous activity. These results support previous suggestions that increased renal sympathetic nerve activity could result in sustained neurogenic renal vasoconstriction and thereby contribute to the development of hypertension.}

METHODS AND  MATERIALS: A total of 112 patients with clinical Stage III NSCLC (American Joint  Commission on Cancer 1997) enrolled in four Radiation Therapy Oncology Group studies  (83-11, 84-03, 84-07, and 88-08 nonchemotherapy arms) at a single institution were  analyzed retrospectively for overall survival (OS) and comorbidity. Of the 112  patients, 105 (94\%) completed their assigned radiotherapy. The median assigned dose  was 50.4 Gy to the lymphatics (range 45-50.4 Gy) and 70.2 Gy to the primary tumor  (range 60-79.2 Gy). Comorbidity was rated retrospectively using the Cumulative  Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) and Charlson scales. Karnofsky  performance scores (KPSs) and weight loss were prospectively recorded. Because only  8 patients had a KPS of {$<$}70, these patients were combined with patients who had a  KPS of 70. The OS of this group was compared with that of the patients with better  KPSs ({$>$}70). RESULTS: The median survival was 10.39 months (range 7.87-12.91). The  2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rate was 20.5\%, 12.5\%, and 7.1\%, respectively. On univariate  analysis, clinical stage (IIIA vs. IIIB) was found to be a statistically significant  factor influencing OS (p = 0.026), and the histologic features, grade, tumor size as  measured on CT scans, age, tobacco use, weight loss {$>$}or=5\%, and total dose delivered  to the primary tumor were not. A KPS of {$<$}or=70 (p = 0.001), the presence of a CIRS-G  score of 4 (extremely severe; p = 0.0002), and a severity index of {$>$}2 (p {$<$}0.0001)  were associated with statistically significant inferior OS. Multivariate analysis  with clinical stage, KPS, and comorbidity (severity index) of all patients showed  that a KPS {$<$}or=70 and severity index {$>$}2 were independently associated with inferior  OS; clinical tumor stage was not found to be an independent prognostic factor.  CONCLUSION: KPS and comorbidity are important independent prognostic factors in  Stage III NSCLC. Comorbidity should be included in protocols studying advanced stage  NSCLC and used for stratification.},

  abstract = {Algorithmic recourse provides explanations that help users overturn an unfavorable decision by a machine learning system. But so far very little attention has been paid to whether providing recourse is beneficial or not. We introduce an abstract learning-theoretic framework that compares the risks (i.e., expected losses) for classification with and without algorithmic recourse. This allows us to answer the question of when providing recourse is beneficial or harmful at the population level. Surprisingly, we find that there are many plausible scenarios in which providing recourse turns out to be harmful, because it pushes users to regions of higher class uncertainty and therefore leads to more mistakes. We further study whether the party deploying the classifier has an incentive to strategize in anticipation of having to provide recourse, and we find that sometimes they do, to the detriment of their users. Providing algorithmic recourse may therefore also be harmful at the systemic level. We confirm our theoretical findings in experiments on simulated and real-world data. All in all, we conclude that the current concept of algorithmic recourse is not reliably beneficial, and therefore requires rethinking.},

In this study, the database of ERIC, the Web of Science, EMBASE, and MEDLINE were searched for the English-language published articles about the functional outcomes and symptomatic improvement in patients after elective surgery for diverticular disease. A majority of clinical trials showed that elective surgery following a successful conservative treatment of acute diverticulitis resulted in significantly better social and functional well-being. In addition, elective surgery greatly reduces the potential events of disease recurrence, thus decreasing financial burden on the national health services.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms. In the sequential arm, patients received induction CT with cisplatin (120 mg/m2) on days 1, 29, and 57, and vinorelbine (30 mg/m2/wk) from day 1 to day 78, followed by thoracic RT at a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions (2 Gy per fraction and 5 fractions per week). In the concurrent arm, the same RT was started on day 1 with two concurrent cycles of cisplatin 20 mg/m2/d and etoposide 50 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 5 and days 29 to 33); patients then received consolidation therapy with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on days 78 and 106 and vinorelbine 30 mg/m2/wk from days 78 to 127. RESULTS: Two hundred five patients were randomly assigned. Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the two arms. There were six toxic deaths in the sequential arm and 10 in the concurrent arm. Median survival was 14.5 months in the sequential arm and 16.3 months in the concurrent arm (log-rank test P = .24). Two-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates were better in the concurrent arm (39\%, 25\%, and 21\%, respectively) than in the sequential arm (26\%, 19\%, and 14\%, respectively). Esophageal toxicity was significantly more frequent in the concurrent arm than in the sequential arm (32\% v 3\%). CONCLUSION: Although not statistically significant, clinically important differences in the median, 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates were observed, with a trend in favor of concurrent chemoradiation therapy, suggesting that is the optimal strategy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC.},

Infusing 10 micrograms/min into the left renal artery increased sodium by approximately 50\%; however, the subsequent infusion of 50 micrograms/min into the thoracic aorta decreased sodium excretion by approximately 60\%, in association with a small reduction of blood pressure. Second, to explore the effect of intrarenal adenosine in tubular sodium handling, free-flow micropuncture experiments were performed. The intrarenal infusion of 10 micrograms/min again caused sodium excretion, but no change in GFR, volume, and sodium deliveries up to the early distal tubule was found. Apparently, the direct effect of adenosine in the kidney is sodium excretion, by a tubular action beyond the early distal tubule. Third, to further characterize the indirect effect, which apparently is sodium retention, adenosine was infused systemically at low rates, in order to avoid a decrease in blood pressure. A 25 micrograms/min infusion again caused sodium retention, in the absence of a fall in blood pressure. After acute left renal denervation, the antinatriuretic effect disappeared in the denervated kidney but remained in the right kidney. These data suggest that increased intrarenal adenosine suppresses sodium reabsorption at some distal nephron site, appropriately decreasing the workload of the kidney. On the other hand, systemic adenosine stimulates sodium reabsorption, an effect that is appropriate to improve systemic circulation and depends on the renal nerves.}

  abstract = {Despite the popularity of ‘modern’ contraceptives, natural family planning (NFP), including fertility awareness-based (FAB) methods and withdrawal, are practised in most countries. Worldwide FAB methods and withdrawal are used, respectively, by about 3.6\% and 2.9\% of all couples of reproductive age. This article describes the underpinnings of the different NFP methods, their rationales, histories, rules for use, efficacy and in broad categories their prevalence. Pregnancy rates of FAB methods with perfect use have ranged between 0.3 and 5.0 per 100 users per year, but typical use rates rises into the teens or higher. Withdrawal requires the male partner to be aware of his impending climax and to pull out of the vagina before ejaculation. Perfect use and typical pregnancy rates for withdrawal are estimated to be 4 and 27 per 100 per year, respectively. Many couples find NFP in accord with their own beliefs, satisfactory in its effectiveness and useful in planning a desired pregnancy. Many prize their self-control in practising NFP or withdrawal. In our research we used Medline, Popline and the Cochrane Library search engines in English, local institutional libraries, our own files in our native languages, the literature references contained therein, and source recommendations from colleagues.}

At issue is how error in the estimates of theseprobabilities affects classification error when the estimates are used ina classification rule. These effects are seen to be somewhat counterintuitive in both their strength and nature. In particular the bias andvariance components of the estimation error combine to influenceclassification in a very different way than with squared error on theprobabilities themselves. Certain types of (very high) bias can becanceled by low variance to produce accurate classification. This candramatically mitigate the effect of the bias associated with some simpleestimators like “naive” Bayes, and the bias induced by thecurse-of-dimensionality on nearest-neighbor procedures. This helps explainwhy such simple methods are often competitive with and sometimes superiorto more sophisticated ones for classification, and why“bagging/aggregating” classifiers can often improveaccuracy. These results also suggest simple modifications to theseprocedures that can (sometimes dramatically) further improve theirclassification performance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether pretreatment CT texture features can improve patient risk stratification beyond conventional prognostic factors (CPFs) in stage III  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively  reviewed 91 cases with stage III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation  therapy. All patients underwent pretreatment diagnostic contrast enhanced computed  tomography (CE-CT) followed by 4-dimensional CT (4D-CT) for treatment simulation. We  used the average-CT and expiratory (T50-CT) images from the 4D-CT along with the  CE-CT for texture extraction. Histogram, gradient, co-occurrence, gray tone  difference, and filtration-based techniques were used for texture feature  extraction. Penalized Cox regression implementing cross-validation was used for  covariate selection and modeling. Models incorporating texture features from the 33  image types and CPFs were compared to those with models incorporating CPFs alone for  overall survival (OS), local-regional control (LRC), and freedom from distant  metastases (FFDM). Predictive Kaplan-Meier curves were generated using leave-one-out  cross-validation. Patients were stratified based on whether their predicted outcome  was above or below the median. Reproducibility of texture features was evaluated  using test-retest scans from independent patients and quantified using concordance  correlation coefficients (CCC). We compared models incorporating the reproducibility  seen on test-retest scans to our original models and determined the classification  reproducibility. RESULTS: Models incorporating both texture features and CPFs  demonstrated a significant improvement in risk stratification compared to models  using CPFs alone for OS (P=.046), LRC (P=.01), and FFDM (P=.005). The average CCCs  were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.67 for texture features extracted from the average-CT,  T50-CT, and CE-CT, respectively. Incorporating reproducibility within our models  yielded 80.4\% (±3.7\% SD), 78.3\% (±4.0\% SD), and 78.8\% (±3.9\% SD) classification  reproducibility in terms of OS, LRC, and FFDM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  Pretreatment tumor texture may provide prognostic information beyond that obtained  from CPFs. Models incorporating feature reproducibility achieved classification  rates of ∼80\%. External validation would be required to establish texture as a  prognostic factor.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The institutional review board approved this retrospective chart review study and  waived the requirement to obtain informed consent. The authors retrospectively  identified 195 patients with stage III NSCLC treated definitively with radiation  therapy between January 2008 and January 2013. All patients underwent pretreatment  PET/computed tomography before treatment. Conventional PET metrics, along with  histogram, shape and volume, and co-occurrence matrix features, were extracted.  Linear predictors of overall survival were developed from leave-one-out  cross-validation. Predictive Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the linear  predictors with both quantitative imaging features and conventional prognostic  factors to those generated with conventional prognostic factors alone. The Harrell  concordance index was used to quantify the discriminatory power of the linear  predictors for survival differences of at least 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Models  were generated with features present in more than 50\% of the cross-validation folds.  RESULTS: Linear predictors of overall survival generated with both quantitative  imaging features and conventional prognostic factors demonstrated improved risk  stratification compared with those generated with conventional prognostic factors  alone in terms of log-rank statistic (P = .18 vs P = .0001, respectively) and  concordance index (0.62 vs 0.58, respectively). The use of quantitative imaging  features selected during cross-validation improved the model using conventional  prognostic factors alone (P = .007). Disease solidity and primary tumor energy from  the co-occurrence matrix were found to be selected in all folds of cross-validation.  CONCLUSION: Pretreatment PET features were associated with overall survival when  adjusting for conventional prognostic factors in patients with stage III NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Systemic hypertension affects almost a quarter of Canadian adults. Although most can achieve adequate blood pressure control using a combination of medical and lifestyle interventions, many have resistant hypertension and are unable to reach their target. Percutaneous renal sympathetic denervation has been developed to address a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of hypertension: renal sympathetic overactivity. In 2009, the first-in-man experience with renal denervation was published. Several studies followed, including the randomized Symplicity HTN-2 trial of 106 patients: 6-month mean blood pressure reduction was 32/12 mm Hg in those who underwent renal denervation, vs a change of +1/0 Hg in those who did not. However, all the evidence to date suffers from the same drawbacks: studies are small, and follow-up is short and largely incomplete. The future of renal denervation will be determined by 3 factors. First, there will be more and better evidence. Symplicity HTN-3 has randomized 530 patients to renal denervation vs a sham procedure; 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be assessed in all participants. Other quality trials will follow, including ones that will assess clinical end points. Second, other indications for this treatment will be investigated. Sympathetic overactivity is implicated in many other conditions, including heart failure and arrhythmia; sympathetic denervation might benefit these patients as well. Third, myriad devices, using different methods to achieve renal denervation, are being developed. The first renal denervation system was approved for clinical use in Canada in March 2012. Until more data are available, patients undergoing this procedure should be carefully screened and, ideally, enrolled in research protocols.},

  abstract = {Resistant hypertension is an increasingly prevalent health problem associated with important adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The pathophysiology that underlies this condition involves increased function of both the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system. A crucial link between these 2 systems is the web of sympathetic fibres that course within the adventitia of the renal arteries. These nerves can be targeted by applying radiofrequency energy from the lumen of the renal arteries to renal artery walls (percutaneous renal sympathetic denervation [RSD]), an approach that has attracted great interest. This paper critically reviews the evidence supporting the use of RSD. Small studies suggest that RSD can produce dramatic blood pressure reductions: In the randomized Symplicity HTN-2 trial of 106 patients, the mean fall in blood pressure at 6 months in patients who received the treatment was 32/12 mm Hg. However, there are limitations to the evidence for RSD in the treatment of resistant hypertension. These include the small number of patients studied; the lack of any placebo-controlled evidence; the fact that blood pressure outcomes were based on office assessments, as opposed to 24-hour ambulatory monitoring; the lack of longer-term efficacy data; and the lack of long-term safety data. Some of these concerns are being addressed in the ongoing Renal Denervation in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension (Symplicity HTN-3) trial. The first percutaneous RSD system was approved by Health Canada in the spring of 2012. But until more and better-quality data are available, this procedure should generally be reserved for those patients whose resistant hypertension is truly uncontrolled.}

METHODS: In a phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 104-week trial conducted at 107 sites in 21 countries, we assigned adults with biopsy-proven, active lupus nephritis in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous belimumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) or matching placebo, in addition to standard therapy. The primary end point at week 104 was a primary efficacy renal response (a ratio of urinary protein to creatinine of ≤0.7, an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] that was no worse than 20\% below the value before the renal flare (pre-flare value) or ≥60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, and no use of rescue therapy), and the major secondary end point was a complete renal response (a ratio of urinary protein to creatinine of {$<$}0.5, an eGFR that was no worse than 10\% below the pre-flare value or ≥90 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, and no use of rescue therapy). The time to a renal-related event or death was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 448 patients underwent randomization (224 to the belimumab group and 224 to the placebo group). At week 104, significantly more patients in the belimumab group than in the placebo group had a primary efficacy renal response (43\% vs. 32\%; odds ratio, 1.6; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 2.3; P\,=\,0.03) and a complete renal response (30\% vs. 20\%; odds ratio, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 2.7; P\,=\,0.02). The risk of a renal-related event or death was lower among patients who received belimumab than among those who received placebo (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.77; P\,=\,0.001). The safety profile of belimumab was consistent with that in previous trials. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving patients with active lupus nephritis, more patients who received belimumab plus standard therapy had a primary efficacy renal response than those who received standard therapy alone.

  abstract = {Background Meta-analyses summarize the magnitude of treatment effect using a number of measures of association, including the odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and/or number needed to treat (NNT). In applying the results of a meta-analysis to individual patients, some textbooks of evidence-based medicine advocate individualizing NNT, based on the RR and the patient's expected event rate (PEER). This approach assumes constant RR but no empirical study to date has examined the validity of this assumption.Methods We randomly selected a subset of meta-analyses from a recent issue of the Cochrane Library (1998, Issue 3). When a meta-analysis pooled more than three randomized controlled trials (RCT) to produce a summary measure for an outcome, we compared the OR, RR and RD of each RCT with the corresponding pooled OR, RR and RD from the meta-analysis of all the other RCT. Using the conventional P-value of 0.05, we calculated the percentage of comparisons in which there were no statistically significant differences in the estimates of OR, RR or RD, and refer to this percentage as the ‘concordance rate’.Results For each effect measure, we made 1843 comparisons, extracted from 55 meta-analyses. The random effects model OR had the highest concordance rate, closely followed by the fixed effects model OR and random effects model RR. The minimum concordance rate for these indices was 82\%, even when the baseline risk differed substantially. The concordance rates for RD, either fixed effects or random effects model, were substantially lower (54–65\%).Conclusions The fixed effects OR, random effects OR and random effects RR appear to be reasonably constant across different baseline risks. Given the interpretational and arithmetic ease of RR, clinicians may wish to rely on the random effects model RR and use the PEER to individualize NNT when they apply the results of a meta-analysis in their practice.}

In the concurrent arm, chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (80 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 29), vindesine (3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 29, and 36), and mitomycin (8 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 29). RT began on day 2 at a dose of 28 Gy (2 Gy per fraction and 5 fractions per week for a total of 14 fractions) followed by a rest period of 10 days, and then repeated. In the sequential arm, the same CT was given, but RT was initiated after completing CT and consisted of 56 Gy (2 Gy per fraction and 5 fractions per week for a total of 28 fractions). RESULTS: Three hundred twenty patients were entered onto the study. Pretreatment characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms. The response rate for the concurrent arm was significantly higher (84. 0\%) than that of the sequential arm (66\%) (P =.0002). The median survival duration was significantly superior in patients receiving concurrent therapy (16.5 months), as compared with those receiving sequential therapy (13.3 months) (P =.03998). Two-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates in the concurrent group (34.6\%, 22.3\%, 16.9\%, and 15.8\%, respectively) were better than those in the sequential group (27.4\%, 14.7\%, 10.1\%, and 8.9\%, respectively). Myelosuppression was significantly greater among patients on the concurrent arm than on the sequential arm (P =.0001). CONCLUSION: In selected patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, the concurrent approach yields a significantly increased response rate and enhanced median survival duration when compared with the sequential approach.},

  abstract = {Certain important nonlinear regression models lead to biased estimates of treatment effect, even in randomized experiments, if needed covariates are omitted. The asymptotic bias is determined both for estimates based on the method of moments and for maximum likelihood estimates. The asymptotic bias from omitting covariates is shown to be zero if the regression of the response variable on treatment and covariates is linear or exponential, and, in regular cases, this is a necessary condition for zero bias. Many commonly used models do have such exponential regressions; thus randomization ensures unbiased treatment estimates in a large number of important nonlinear models. For moderately censored exponential survival data, analysis with the exponential survival model yields less biased estimates of treatment effect than analysis with the proportional hazards model of Cox, if needed covariates are omitted. Simulations confirm that calculations of asymptotic bias are in excellent agreement with the bias observed in experiments of modest size.}

  abstract = {The kidney has both afferent (sensory) and efferent (sympathetic) nerves that can influence renal function. Renal innervation has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of many forms of hypertension. Hypertension and flank pain are common clinical manifestations of autosomal dominant (AD) polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We hypothesize that renal innervation contributes to the hypertension and progression of cystic change in rodent PKD. In the present study, the contribution of renal innervation to hypertension and progression of renal histopathology and dysfunction was assessed in male Han:SPRD-Cy/+ rats with ADPKD. At 4 weeks of age, male offspring from crosses of heterozygotes (Cy/+) were randomized into either 1) bilateral surgical renal denervation, 2) surgical sham denervation control, or 3) nonoperated control groups. A midline laparotomy was performed to allow the renal denervation (i.e., physical stripping of the nerves and painting the artery with phenol/alcohol). Blood pressure (tail cuff method), renal function (BUN) and histology were assessed at 8 weeks of age. Bilateral renal denervation reduced the cystic kidney size, cyst volume density, systolic blood pressure, and improved renal function (BUN) as compared with nonoperated controls. Operated control cystic rats had kidney weights, cyst volume densities, systolic blood pressures, and plasma BUN levels that were intermediate between those in the denervated animals and the nonoperated controls. The denervated group had a reduced systolic blood pressure compared with the operated control animals, indicating that the renal innervations was a major contributor to the hypertension in this model of ADPKD. Renal denervation was efficacious in reducing some pathology, including hypertension, renal enlargement, and cystic pathology. However, sham operation also affected the cystic disease but to a lesser extent. We hypothesize that the amelioration of hypertension in Cy/+ rats was due to the effects of renal denervation on the renin angiotensin system.}

It is a web-accessible international resource for development, training, and evaluation of computer-assisted diagnostic (CAD) methods for lung cancer detection and diagnosis. Initiated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), further advanced by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), and accompanied by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through active participation, this public-private partnership demonstrates the success of a consortium founded on a consensus-based process. Seven academic centers and eight medical imaging companies collaborated to create this data set which contains 1018 cases. Each subject includes images from a clinical thoracic CT scan and an associated XML file that records the results of a two-phase image annotation process performed by four experienced thoracic radiologists. In the initial blinded-read phase, each radiologist independently reviewed each CT scan and marked lesions belonging to one of three categories ("nodule \&gt; or =3 mm," "nodule \&lt;3 mm," and "non-nodule \&gt; or =3 mm"). In the subsequent unblinded-read phase, each radiologist independently reviewed their own marks along with the anonymized marks of the three other radiologists to render a final opinion. The goal of this process was to identify as completely as possible all lung nodules in each CT scan without requiring forced consensus.}

  abstract = {In many areas, we have well-founded insights about causal structure that would be useful to bring into our trained models while still allowing them to learn in a data-driven fashion. To achieve this, we present the new method of interchange intervention training (IIT). In IIT, we (1) align variables in a causal model (e.g., a deterministic program or Bayesian network) with representations in a neural model and (2) train the neural model to match the counterfactual behavior of the causal model on a base input when aligned representations in both models are set to be the value they would be for a source input. IIT is fully differentiable, flexibly combines with other objectives, and guarantees that the target causal model is a causal abstraction of the neural model when its loss is zero. We evaluate IIT on a structural vision task (MNIST-PVR), a navigational language task (ReaSCAN), and a natural language inference task (MQNLI). We compare IIT against multi-task training objectives and data augmentation. In all our experiments, IIT achieves the best results and produces neural models that are more interpretable in the sense that they more successfully realize the target causal model.},

We evaluated these metrics in patients treated with definitive  radiation therapy (RT). We also evaluated outcomes after progression on  mid-radiotherapy PET/CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-seven patients treated with  RT with or without chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Primary  tumor and involved nodes were delineated. PET metrics included metabolic tumor  volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and SUV(max). For mid-radiotherapy PET,  both absolute value of these metrics and percentage decrease were analyzed. The  influence of PET metrics on time to death, local recurrence, and regional/distant  recurrence was assessed using Cox regression. RESULTS: 91\% of patients had  concurrent chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 14months. None of the PET metrics were  associated with overall survival. Several were positively associated with local  recurrence: pre-radiotherapy MTV, and mid-radiotherapy MTV and TLG (p=0.03-0.05).  Ratio of mid- to pre-treatment SUV(max) was associated with regional/distant  recurrence (p=0.02). 5/77 mid-radiotherapy scans showed early out-of-field  progression. All of these patients died. CONCLUSIONS: Several PET metrics were  associated with risk of recurrence. Progression on mid-radiotherapy PET/CT was a  poor prognostic factor.},

Based on analyses of this new database, the existing seventh edition AJCC stage IV database, and contemporary clinical trial data, the AJCC Melanoma Expert Panel introduced several important changes to the Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis (TNM) classification and stage grouping criteria. Key changes in the eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual include: 1) tumor thickness measurements to be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm, not 0.01 mm; 2) definitions of T1a and T1b are revised (T1a, {$<$}0.8 mm without ulceration; T1b, 0.8-1.0 mm with or without ulceration or {$<$}0.8 mm with ulceration), with mitotic rate no longer a T category criterion; 3) pathological (but not clinical) stage IA is revised to include T1b N0 M0 (formerly pathologic stage IB); 4) the N category descriptors “microscopic” and “macroscopic” for regional node metastasis are redefined as “clinically occult” and “clinically apparent”; 5) prognostic stage III groupings are based on N category criteria and T category criteria (ie, primary tumor thickness and ulceration) and increased from 3 to 4 subgroups (stages IIIA-IIID); 6) definitions of N subcategories are revised, with the presence of microsatellites, satellites, or in-transit metastases now categorized as N1c, N2c, or N3c based on the number of tumor-involved regional lymph nodes, if any; 7) descriptors are added to each M1 subcategory designation for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (LDH elevation no longer upstages to M1c); and 8) a new M1d designation is added for central nervous system metastases. This evidence-based revision of the AJCC melanoma staging system will guide patient treatment, provide better prognostic estimates, and refine stratification of patients entering clinical trials.

Recently, synthetic ECGs were used to enrich sparse clinical data or even replace them completely during training leading to improved performance on real-world clinical test data. We thus generated a novel synthetic database comprising a total of 16,900 12 lead ECGs based on electrophysiological simulations equally distributed into healthy control and 7 pathology classes. The pathological case of myocardial infraction had 6 sub-classes. A comparison of extracted features between the virtual cohort and a publicly available clinical ECG database demonstrated that the synthetic signals represent clinical ECGs for healthy and pathological subpopulations with high fidelity.

  abstract = {Aim: To assess whether changes in body composition could be assessed serially using conventional thoracic computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging in patients receiving induction chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods: CT-based skeletal muscle volume and density were measured retrospectively from thoracic and lumbar segment CT images from 88 patients with newly diagnosed and untreated NSCLC before and after induction chemotherapy. Skeletal muscle 2-[ 18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake was measured from PET/CT images from a subset of patients (n=42). Comparisons of each metric before and after induction chemotherapy were conducted using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data. The association between clinical factors and percentage change in muscle volume was examined using univariate linear regression models, with adjustment for baseline muscle volume. Results: Following induction chemotherapy, thoracic (–3.3\%, p=0.0005) and lumbar (–2.6\%, p=0.0101) skeletal muscle volume were reduced (adiposity remained unchanged). The proportion of skeletal muscle with a density \&lt;0 HU increased (7.9\%, p\&lt;0.0001), reflecting a decrease in skeletal muscle density and skeletal muscle FDG uptake increased (10.4–31\%, p\&lt;0.05). No imaging biomarkers were correlated with overall survival. Conclusion: Changes in body composition can be measured from routine thoracic imaging. During chemotherapy skeletal muscle volume and metabolism are altered; however, there was no impact on survival in this retrospective series, and further validation in prospective, well-controlled studies are required. © 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists},

This concepts paper examines prognostic clinical risk prediction and specifically describes the potential impact of treatment effects in model development studies. Treatment effects may lead to models failing to achieve the aim of identifying the patients most likely to benefit from intervention, and may instead identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from intervention.

  abstract = {Resistant hypertension, defined as failure to reach blood pressure (BP) goals despite treatment with ≥3 antihypertensive agents, one of which is a diuretic, bears a significant risk of cardiovascular complications. Strong evidence exists, implicating the overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in the pathogenesis of resistant hypertension through complex neurohormonal interactions. Renal denervation is a novel attractive option to achieve adequate blockade of the sympathetic system, with subsequent BP reductions in patients with resistant hypertension. Data have shown promising results regarding the efficacy of the procedure, maintaining a favorable safety profile. As such, the paradigm of resistant hypertension has expanded in other conditions involving a hyperadrenergic state such as the metabolic syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, sleep apnea, and renal failure. This review focuses on the pathophysiological rationale of modifying SNS tone and the evidence of the benefits of such intervention beyond BP control.},

  abstract = {Background Estimating the clinical probability of malignancy in patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) can facilitate the selection and interpretation of subsequent diagnostic tests. Methods We used multiple logistic regression analysis to identify independent clinical predictors of malignancy and to develop a parsimonious clinical prediction model to estimate the pretest probability of malignancy in a geographically diverse sample of 375 veterans with SPNs. We used data from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databases and a recently completed VA Cooperative Study that evaluated the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) scans for the diagnosis of SPNs. Results The mean (± SD) age of subjects in the sample was 65.9 ± 10.7 years. The prevalence of malignant SPNs was 54\%. Most participants were either current smokers (n = 177) or former smokers (n = 177). Independent predictors of malignant SPNs included a positive smoking history (odds ratio [OR], 7.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 23.6), older age (OR, 2.2 per 10-year increment; 95\% CI, 1.7 to 2.8), larger nodule diameter (OR, 1.1 per 1-mm increment; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.2), and time since quitting smoking (OR, 0.6 per 10-year increment; 95\% CI, 0.5 to 0.7). Model accuracy was very good (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.84), and there was excellent agreement between the predicted probability and the observed frequency of malignant SPNs. Conclusions Our prediction rule can be used to estimate the pretest probability of malignancy in patients with SPNs, and thereby facilitate clinical decision making when selecting and interpreting the results of diagnostic tests such as PET imaging.},

  abstract = {Summary Itching is the predominant symptom of skin disease but it is ill-understood and a challenge for future research. Even the major nerve pathways for itch, and its relationship to pain are debatable. In inflamed skin, histamine plays a major role and its mode of release from mast cells in, for example, chronic urticaria is now better appreciated. Tachykinins including substance P and cytokines including interleukin-2 are evidently important peripherally. Opioid u-receptor-dependent processes activate inhibitory circuits in the central nervous system and regulate the extent of intensity and quality of perceived itch. It is proposed that stimulation of large areas of skin such as by scratching, generates inhibitory activity which suppresses itch excitation. Therapeutic intervention based upon understanding these regulatory processes is a real prospect.}

The data were collected as part of the baseline measures of a hypertension control trial. Of 140 monitored primary care patients, all with uncontrolled office blood pressure, 69 (49\%) were on at least three antihypertensives of different classes.

Thirty-one (91\%) of the 34 uncontrolled RH patients were prescribed a diuretic, of which 24 were on hydrochlorothiazide 25~mg. Less than half of the patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker were prescribed maximal doses of these agents. Half of the RH can be attributed to white coat effect and poor medication adherence, and all of the remaining patients were on apparently suboptimal drug combinations and/or dosages.

  abstract = {Readers of medical literature need to consider two types of validity, internal and external. Internal validity means that the study measured what it set out to; external validity is the ability to generalise from the study to the reader's patients. With respect to internal validity, selection bias, information bias, and confounding are present to some degree in all observational research. Selection bias stems from an absence of comparability between groups being studied. Information bias results from incorrect determination of exposure, outcome, or both. The effect of information bias depends on its type. If information is gathered differently for one group than for another, bias results. By contrast, non-differential misclassification tends to obscure real differences. Confounding is a mixing or blurring of effects: a researcher attempts to relate an exposure to an outcome but actually measures the effect of a third factor (the confounding variable). Confounding can be controlled in several ways: restriction, matching, stratification, and more sophisticated multivariate techniques. If a reader cannot explain away study results on the basis of selection, information, or confounding bias, then chance might be another explanation. Chance should be examined last, however, since these biases can account for highly significant, though bogus results. Differentiation between spurious, indirect, and causal associations can be difficult. Criteria such as temporal sequence, strength and consistency of an association, and evidence of a dose-response effect lend support to a causal link.},

Study Design and Setting Simulations were performed based on two normally distributed predictors, a binary outcome, and a binary treatment, mimicking a randomized trial or an observational study. Comparison was made between simply ignoring treatment (SIT), restricting the analytical data set to untreated individuals (AUT), inverse probability weighting (IPW), and explicit modeling of treatment (MT). Methods were compared in terms of predictive performance of the model and the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. Results Omitting a genuine predictor of the outcome from the prognostic model decreased model performance, in both an observational study and a randomized trial. In randomized trials, the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions was smaller when applying AUT or MT, compared to SIT and IPW. In observational studies, MT was superior to all other methods regarding the proportion of incorrect treatment decisions. Conclusion If a prognostic model aims to produce correct probabilities of the outcome in the absence of treatment, ignoring treatments that affect that outcome can lead to suboptimal model performance and incorrect treatment decisions.

Targeted interventions for renal nerve ablation are being developed for treatment of drug resistant hypertension in the USA and rest of the world. Early studies with the use of radiofrequency based renal denervation systems have shown encouraging results with significant reduction of blood pressure in patients inadequately controlled despite nearly maximal drug therapy regimens. Thus far, the renal denervation procedure has been associated with minimal side effects. Long term efficacy and safety beyond 3 years needs to be determined for renal nerve ablation. This review focuses on the physiology of the renal sympathetic system, the rationale for renal nerve ablation and current evidence in support of the available therapeutic renal denervation systems.}

ITT analysis maintains prognostic balance generated from the original random treatment allocation. In ITT analysis, estimate of treatment effect is generally conservative.

  abstract = {Treatment decisions in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are made based on the extent of the disease. However, the outcome varies among patients at the same stage. A simple tool to predict outcomes in SCLC patients would be helpful for clinical decision-making. In recent years, several prognostic scores have been proposed. In this study, we evaluated the different prognostic factors in an unselected real-world cohort of patients. We retrospectively collected clinical, radiological and laboratory data from 92 patients diagnosed with SCLC. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses of survival were performed to assess the prognostic value of relevant clinical and laboratory factors for SCLC. Furthermore, we examined the association between eight published prognostic scores for SCLC and overall survival (OS). In the overall cohort, the median OS was 10.3 months (20.9 months and 9.2 months for limited disease (LD) SCLC and extensive disease (ED) SCLC, respectively). In univariate analysis, initial staging, number of metastatic sites and presence of liver, bone and adrenal gland metastases were significantly associated with worse OS. Of the established laboratory markers, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and hyponatremia but not lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) significantly predicted OS. All published prognostic scores, with the exception of the Glasgow Prognostic Score, did not significantly predict OS. In multivariate analysis, age, staging and alkaline phosphatase serum levels showed significant association with OS. We could not confirm the prognostic significance of most of the published complex prognostic scores. We therefore recommend using simple clinical and laboratory factors instead of complex scores to estimate the prognosis of SCLC patients in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Obesity-induced hypertension, like all forms of experimental and human hypertension studied thus far, is associated with renal dysfunction characterized by the resetting of pressure natriuresis. In obese subjects, this resetting is primarily a result of increased renal tubular reabsorption as glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow are markedly elevated. Obesity activates the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, and causes insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, all of which have been postulated to increase tubular reabsorption and raise blood pressure. In humans and dogs, chronic hyperinsulinemia, comparable to that found in obesity, does not cause hypertension even in the presence of insulin resistance. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system appears to be important in obesity, as chronic adrenergic blockade or renal denervation greatly ameliorates the hypertension associated with weight gain. Resetting of pressure natriuresis in obesity may also be attributable to altered intrarenal forces caused by histologic changes in the renal medulla that may compress the loops of Henle and vasa recta, increase tubular sodium reabsorption, and activate the renin-angiotensin system. The quantitative importance of these intrarenal changes and their interrelationship with neurohumoral activation in obesity is an important area for further investigation.},

Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic.

  abstract = {Young women tend to have lower blood pressure, and less risk of hypertension, compared to young men. As people age, both blood pressure and the risk of hypertension increase in both sexes; this occurs most strikingly in women after menopause. However, the mechanisms for these influences of sex and age remain incompletely understood. In this review we are specifically interested in the interaction between neural (sympathetic nerve activity; SNA) and haemodynamic factors (cardiac output, blood pressure and vascular resistance) and how these change with sex and age. While peripheral vascular SNA can vary 7- to 10–fold among normotensive young men and women, it is reproducible in a given individual. Surprisingly, higher levels of SNA are not associated with higher blood pressures in these groups. In young men, high SNA is associated with higher total peripheral vascular resistance (TPR), and appears to be balanced by lower cardiac output and less peripheral vascular responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. Young women do not exhibit the SNA–TPR relationship. Recent evidence suggests that β–adrenergic vasodilatation offsets the vasoconstrictor effects of α–adrenergic vasoconstriction in young women, which may contribute to the generally lower blood pressures in this group. Sympathetic nerve activity increases with age, and in groups over 40, levels of SNA are more tightly linked to levels of blood pressure. The potentially protective β–adrenergic effect seen in young women appears to be lost after menopause and probably contributes to the increased blood pressure and increased risk of hypertension seen in older women.},

  abstract = {Data collection for natural language (NL) understanding tasks has increasingly included human explanations alongside data points, allowing past works to introduce models that both perform a task and generate NL explanations for their outputs. Yet to date, model-generated explanations have been evaluated on the basis of surface-level similarities to human explanations, both through automatic metrics like BLEU and human evaluations. We argue that these evaluations are insufficient, since they fail to indicate whether explanations support actual model behavior (faithfulness), rather than simply match what a human would say (plausibility). In this work, we address the problem of evaluating explanations from the the model simulatability perspective. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce a leakage-adjusted simulatability (LAS) metric for evaluating NL explanations, which measures how well explanations help an observer predict a model's output, while controlling for how explanations can directly leak the output. We use a model as a proxy for a human observer, and validate this choice with two human subject experiments. (2) Using the CoS-E and e-SNLI datasets, we evaluate two existing generative graphical models and two new approaches; one rationalizing method we introduce achieves roughly human-level LAS scores. (3) Lastly, we frame explanation generation as a multi-agent game and optimize explanations for simulatability while penalizing label leakage, which can improve LAS scores.},

The aim of this study is to retrospectively examine the prognostic significance of 18F-FDG uptake as a predictive marker of anti-PD-1 antibody. Eighty-five patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent 18F-FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) just before administration of nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy were eligible in our study, and metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and the maximum of standardized under value (SUVmax) on 18F-FDG uptake were assessed. Objective response rate, median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 36.6\%, 161 days and 716 days, respectively. The frequency of any immune-related adverse events was significantly higher in patients with low 18F-FDG uptake on PET than in those with high uptake. By multivariate analysis, the tumor metabolic activity by TLG and MTV was identified as an independent prognostic factor for predicting outcome after anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, but not SUVmax, predominantly in patients with adenocarcinoma. Metabolic tumor indices as TLG and MTV on 18F-FDG uptake could predict the prognosis after anti-PD-1 antibodies in patients with previously treated NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Purpose Readmission of patients colonized with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMRB) is important in the nosocomial dynamics of AMRB. We assessed the duration of colonization after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) with highly resistant Enterobacteriaceae (HRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Methods Data were obtained from a cluster-randomized trial in 13 ICUs in 8 European countries (MOSAR-ICU trial, 2008–2011). All patients were screened on admission and twice weekly for AMRB. All patients colonized with HRE, MRSA, or VRE and readmitted to the same ICU during the study period were included in the current analysis. Time between discharge and readmission was calculated, and the colonization status at readmission was assessed. Because of interval-censored data, a maximum likelihood analysis was used to calculate the survival function, taking censoring into account. A nonparametric two-sample test was used to test for differences in the survival curves. Results The MOSAR-ICU trial included 14,390 patients, and a total of 64,997 cultures were taken from 8,974 patients admitted for at least 3 days. One hundred twenty-five unique patients had 141 episodes with AMRB colonization and at least 1 readmission. Thirty-two patients were colonized with two or more AMRBs. Median times until clearance were 4.8 months for all AMRB together, 1.4 months for HRE, {$<$}1 month for MRSA, and 1.5 months for VRE. There were no significant differences between the survival curves. Conclusion Fifty percent of the patients had lost colonization when readmitted 2 or more months after previous ICU discharge.},

The two- and five-year survival rates  were 27\% and 12\% for stage IIIA, and 18\% and 8\% for stage IIIB, respectively (P =  0.052). By univariate analysis, a primary tumor less than 5 cm in diameter was also  an important predictor of survival (P = 0.008). As for tumor location, the patients  with primary tumors in the upper lobes or the superior segment of the lower lobes of  the lung lived longer than those with primary tumors at any other site (P = 0.032).  Patients with epidermoid carcinoma had a higher survival rate at 5 years than those  with other histologic types (14\% vs 3\%, P = 0.074). Multivariate analysis showed  that among tumor characteristics, the site of the primary tumor, the pattern of  tumor spread and N stage were significantly associated with overall survival. Among  the patients with stage III NSCLC, those with stage IIIA epidermoid carcinoma in the  upper lobe or the superior segment of the lower lobe of the lung were considered to  be the most favorable candidates for definitive radiation therapy.},

  abstract = {1. It is well accepted that some of the long-term effects of angiotensin (Ang) II are mediated via the central nervous system. Some of these actions that are mediated by the circumventricular organs and the baroreceptor reflex are thought to then alter sympathetic nervous system activity. In particular, there is some debate as to the role of renal nerves in the chronic effects of AngII. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the renal nerves in a long-term model of progressive AngII-induced hypertension. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to either bilateral renal denervation (RDX; n = 7) or sham surgery (SHAM; n = 8). Rats were instrumented with radiotelemetric transducers and venous catheters for the measurement of blood pressure and AngII infusion, respectively. A 4.0\% NaCl diet and distilled water were provided ad libitum. The first 3 days served as the control period (7 mL/day, 0.9\% NaCl, i.v.). This was followed by an infusion of AngII for 16 days (10 ng/kg per min, i.v.) and a 3 day recovery period identical to control. 3. Baseline arterial pressure between RDX and SHAM rats did not differ. Following AngII treatment, the arterial pressure of SHAM rats increased more rapidly than that of RDX rats. By Day 10 of treatment, the mean arterial pressure was significantly different between groups, having increased to 166 +/- 4 mmHg in SHAM rats and 135 +/- 11 mmHg in RDX rats. This trend continued for the remainder of AngII treatment. 4. The present results indicate that the renal nerves are necessary for the full expression of AngII-induced hypertension.}

Although automated screening tools can detect patients currently experiencing severe sepsis and septic shock, none predict those at greatest risk of developing shock. We analyzed routinely available physiological and laboratory data from intensive care unit patients and developed "TREWScore," a targeted real-time early warning score that predicts which patients will develop septic shock. TREWScore identified patients before the onset of septic shock with an area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) of 0.83 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.81 to 0.85]. At a specificity of 0.67, TREWScore achieved a sensitivity of 0.85 and identified patients a median of 28.2 [interquartile range (IQR), 10.6 to 94.2] hours before onset. Of those identified, two-thirds were identified before any sepsis-related organ dysfunction. In comparison, the Modified Early Warning Score, which has been used clinically for septic shock prediction, achieved a lower AUC of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.76). A routine screening protocol based on the presence of two of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, suspicion of infection, and either hypotension or hyperlactatemia achieved a lower sensitivity of 0.74 at a comparable specificity of 0.64. Continuous sampling of data from the electronic health records and calculation of TREWScore may allow clinicians to identify patients at risk for septic shock and provide earlier interventions that would prevent or mitigate the associated morbidity and mortality.},

  abstract = {Background Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a significant predictor of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) efficacy. This study investigated the correlation between deep learning radiomic biomarker and TMB, including its predictive value for ICIs treatment response in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods CT images from 327 patients with TMB data (TMB median=6.067 mutations per megabase (range: 0 to 42.151)) were retrospectively collected and randomly divided into a training (n=236), validation (n=26), and test cohort (n=65). We used 3D-densenet to estimate the target tumor area, which used 1020 deep learning features to distinguish High-TMB from Low-TMB patients and establish the TMB radiomic biomarker (TMBRB). The TMBRB was developed in the training cohort combined with validation cohort and evaluated in the test cohort. The predictive value of TMBRB was assessed in a cohort of 123 NSCLC patients who had received ICIs (survival median=462 days (range: 16 to 1128)). Results TMBRB discriminated between High-TMB and Low-TMB patients in the training cohort (area under the curve (AUC): 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.84 to 0.87))and test cohort (AUC: 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.77 to 0.85). In this study, the predictive value of TMBRB was better than that of a histological subtype (AUC of training cohort: 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.72 to 0.77; AUC of test cohort: 0.71, 95\% CI: 0.66 to 0.76) or Radiomic model (AUC of training cohort: 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.72 to 0.77; AUC of test cohort: 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.69 to 0.79). When predicting immunotherapy efficacy, TMBRB divided patients into a high- and low-risk group with distinctly different overall survival (OS; HR: 0.54, 95\% CI: 0.31 to 0.95; p=0.030) and progression-free survival (PFS; HR: 1.78, 95\% CI: 1.07 to 2.95; p=0.023). Moreover, TMBRB had a better predictive ability when combined with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (OS: p=0.007; PFS: p=0.003). Visual analysis revealed that tumor microenvironment was important for predicting TMB. Conclusion By combining deep learning technology and CT images, we developed an individual non-invasive biomarker that could distinguish High-TMB from Low-TMB, which might inform decisions on the use of ICIs in patients with advanced NSCLC.},

Whether alterations of arterial stiffness may contribute to BP-lowering effects of RDN is unknown. METHODS: We measured office BP and arterial stiffness using fingertip tonometry-derived augmentation index (EndoPAT2000) at baseline and at 3-month follow-up in 50 consecutive patients with resistant hypertension. Forty patients received RDN and 10 patients served as controls. MSNA was obtained in 20 RDN and 10 non-RDN patients. RESULTS: Baseline BP averaged 170/92 ± 19/15 mmHg (RDN) and 171/93 ± 14/8{$\mkern1mu$}mmHg (non-RDN) despite the use of 4.9 ± 1.9 and 4.4 ± 2.0 antihypertensive drugs, respectively. RDN significantly reduced SBP (170{$\mkern1mu$} ± 19 vs. 154 ± 25{$\mkern1mu$}mmHg; P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001) and DBP (92 ± 15 vs. 84 ± 16 mmHg; P{$<$}0.001), augmentation index (30.6 {$\mkern1mu$}± 23.8 vs. 22.7 ± 22.4\%; P=0.002), AI@75 corrected for heart rate (22.4 ± 21.6 vs. 14.4 ± 20.7; P=0.002) and MSNA (80 ± 15 vs. 71 ± 18 {$\mkern1mu$}bursts/100 heartbeats; P{$<$}0.01). Changes in AI@75 with RDN were unrelated to SBP (r=0.043; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.79), and DBP (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.092; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.57) and MSNA changes (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-0.17; P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.49). No changes in BP, augmentation index, AI@75 or MSNA were observed in the non-RDN group. CONCLUSION: RDN results in a substantial and rapid reduction in augmentation index, which appears to be independent of BP and MSNA changes. These findings are indicative of a beneficial effect of RDN on arterial stiffness in patients with resistant hypertension and may contribute to the sustained BP-lowering effect of RDN.},

The mechanisms underlying sympathetic neural inhibition are unknown. We examined whether RDN differentially influences the sympathetic discharge pattern of vasoconstrictor neurons in patients with resistant hypertension. Standardized office BP, single-unit MSNA, and multi-unit MSNA were obtained at baseline and at 3-month follow-up in 35 patients with resistant hypertension. Twenty-five patients underwent RDN, and 10 patients underwent repeated measurements without RDN (non-RDN). Baseline BP averaged 164/93 mm Hg (RDN) and 164/87 mm Hg (non-RDN) despite use of an average of 4.8 ± 0.4 and 4.4 ± 0.5 antihypertensive drugs, respectively. Mean office BP decreased significantly by -13/-6 mm Hg for systolic BP (P{$<$}0.001) and diastolic BP (P{$<$}0.05) with RDN but not in non-RDN at 3-month follow-up. RDN moderately decreased multi-unit MSNA (79 ± 3 versus 73 ± 4 bursts/100 heartbeats; P{$<$}0.05), whereas all properties of single-unit MSNA including firing rates of individual vasoconstrictor fibers (43 ± 5 versus 27 ± 3 spikes/100 heartbeats; P{$<$}0.01), firing probability (30 ± 2 versus 22 ± 2\% per heartbeat; P{$<$}0.02), and multiple firing incidence of single units within a cardiac cycle (8 ± 1 versus 4 ± 1\% per heartbeat; P{$<$}0.05) were substantially reduced at follow-up. BP, single-unit MSNA, and multi-unit MSNA remained unaltered in the non-RDN cohort at follow-up. RDN results in the substantial and rapid reduction in firing properties of single sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibers, this being more pronounced than multi-unit MSNA inhibition. Whether the earlier changes in single-unit firing patterns may predict long-term BP response to RDN warrants further exploration.},

Office BP and MSNA were obtained at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after RDN in 35 patients with resistant hypertension. Office BP averaged 166±22/88±19 mm Hg, despite the use of an average of 4.8±2.1 antihypertensive drugs. Baseline MSNA was 51±11 bursts/min ≈2- to 3-fold higher than the level observed in healthy controls. Mean office systolic and diastolic BP significantly decreased by -12.6±18.3/-6.5±9.2, -16.1±25.6/-8.6±12.9, and -21.2±29.1/-11.1±12.9 mm Hg (P{$<$}0.001 for both systolic BP and diastolic BP) with RDN at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, respectively. MSNA was reduced by -8±12, -6±12, and -6±11 bursts/min (P{$<$}0.01) at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. The reduction in MSNA was maintained, despite a progressive fall in BP over time. No such changes were observed in 7 control subjects at 6-month follow-up. These findings confirm previous reports on the favorable effects of RDN on elevated BP and demonstrate sustained reduction of central sympathetic outflow ≤1-year follow-up in patients with resistant hypertension and high baseline MSNA. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis of a substantial contribution of afferent renal nerve signaling to increased BP in resistant hypertension and argue against a relevant reinnervation at 1 year after procedure.},

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment—the target experiment or target trial—that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During internships most medical students engage in history taking and physical examination during evaluation of hospitalized patients. However, the students' ability for pattern recognition is not as developed as in medical experts and complete history taking is often not repeated by an expert, so important clues may be missed. On the other hand, students' history taking is usually more extensive than experts' history taking and medical students discuss their findings with a Supervisor. Thus the effect of student involvement on diagnostic accuracy is unclear. We therefore compared the diagnostic accuracy for patients in the medical emergency department with and without student involvement in the evaluation process. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients in the medical emergency department were assigned to evaluation by either a supervised medical student or an emergency department physician. We only included patients who were admitted to our hospital and subsequently cared for by another medical team on the ward. We compared the working diagnosis from the emergency department with the discharge diagnosis. A total of 310 patients included in the study were cared for by 41 medical students and 21 emergency department physicians. The working diagnosis was changed in 22\% of the patients evaluated by physicians evaluation and in 10\% of the patients evaluated by supervised medical students (p = .006). There was no difference in the expenditures for diagnostic procedures, length of stay in the emergency department or patient comorbidity complexity level. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Involvement of closely supervised medical students in the evaluation process of hospitalized medical patients leads to an improved diagnostic accuracy compared to evaluation by an emergency department physician alone.},

METHODS: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), as well as usual  clinical, laboratory (including C-reactive protein [CRP] concentrations), and  pathologic data were retrospectively retrieved from files of 161 consecutive  patients treated by pneumonectomy for NSCLC, whose preoperative computed tomographic  (CT) scans were available in the Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) of  the hospital. Cross-sectional areas of right and left psoas areas (measured by CT  scan at the L3 level), perirenal fat thickness, and anterior subcutaneous tissue  thickness at the left renal vein level were also assessed. RESULTS: BMI and total  psoas area were strongly and directly correlated (p~= 0.0000001), whereas BMI was  inversely related to CRP levels. Sarcopenia (total psoas area ≤33rd percentile) was  associated with high CRP levels ({$>$}20 mg/L) (p~= 0.010). Factors associated with  90-day mortality included older age (p~= 0.000045), lower body weight (p~= 0.032),  and BMI less than or equal to 25 kg/m(2) (p~= 0.013). At univariate analysis,  long-term outcome was negatively affected by a nonsquamous~cell histologic type (p~=  0.011), pathologic stage IIIB-IV (p~=0.026), CRP levels greater than 20~mg/L (p~=  0.017), BMI less than or equal to 25 kg/m(2) (p~= 0.010), and total psoas area less  than or equal to the 33rd percentile (p~= 0.029). Multivariate analysis showed the  independent prognostic value of both BMI and total psoas area. CONCLUSIONS: BMI less  than or equal to 25 kg/m(2) and total psoas cross-sectional area less than or equal  to the 33rd percentile are prognostic determinants in patients with NSCLC requiring  pneumonectomy.},

  abstract = {Flaws in the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of randomised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated. The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias aims to make the process clearer and more accurate Randomised trials, and systematic reviews of such trials, provide the most reliable evidence about the effects of healthcare interventions. Provided that there are enough participants, randomisation should ensure that participants in the intervention and comparison groups are similar with respect to both known and unknown prognostic factors. Differences in outcomes of interest between the different groups can then in principle be ascribed to the causal effect of the intervention.1 Causal inferences from randomised trials can, however, be undermined by flaws in design, conduct, analyses, and reporting, leading to underestimation or overestimation of the true intervention effect (bias).2 However, it is usually impossible to know the extent to which biases have affected the results of a particular trial. Systematic reviews aim to collate and synthesise all studies that meet prespecified eligibility criteria3 using methods that attempt to minimise bias. To obtain reliable conclusions, review authors must carefully consider the potential limitations of the included studies. The notion of study “quality” is not well defined but relates to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis, and presentation were appropriate to answer its research question. Many tools for assessing the quality of randomised trials are available, including scales (which score the trials) and checklists (which assess trials without producing a score).4 5 6 7 Until recently, Cochrane reviews used a variety of these tools, mainly checklists.8 In 2005 the Cochrane Collaboration’s methods groups embarked on a new strategy for assessing the quality of randomised trials. In this paper we describe the collaboration’s new risk of bias …},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer has the potential for cure, treatment is avoided in patients with interstitial lung disease  because of the risk for severe radiation pneumonitis. Interstitial lung  abnormalities (ILA) can be evaluated using high-resolution computed tomography  (HRCT) to assess interstitial changes. In this study, we retrospectively examined  the feasibility and efficacy of chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer  patients with ILA. METHODS: Patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy for locally  advanced lung cancer at Okayama University Hospital between 2012 and 2015 were  reviewed retrospectively. HRCT prior to treatment was evaluated by one pulmonologist  and two radiologists using a sequential reading method. RESULTS: Of the 77 patients  enrolled in this study, ILA was present in 25 (32.5\%) and indeterminate ILA in 24  patients; 28 patients did not have ILA. Desaturation at rest (SpO2 {$<$} 95\%) and  honeycombing on HRCT were not observed in ILA patients. Only one patient with ILA  had a low vital capacity (\%VC {$<$} 80\%). Severe radiation pneumonitis (≥Grade 2)  occurred in 36.0\% of the patients with ILA, but it was controllable; Grade 4 or 5  was not observed. Multivariate analysis showed that {$>$}25\% of the lung volume  receiving {$>$}20 Gy was risk factors of severe radiation pneumonitis, but ILA was not.  The 2-year survival rates of patients with and without ILA were 56.8\% and 74.1\%,  respectively, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS:  Chemoradiotherapy was feasible and effective in some patient population with ILA  without desaturation, low VC and honeycombing on HRCT.},

Regrettably, the usual decision-theoretic approach ignores this latter aspect. Elicitation of utilities, decision contemplation and prognostic counselling interweave, diagnostics playing a subsidiary role in decision-oriented clinical practice. At times the doctor has grounds for withholding information. As this is known to the patient, prognostic counselling becomes a conflict-prone and rationality-thwarting activity.

Summary Background Antiplatelet therapy is widely used in secondary prevention after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke. Bleeding is the main adverse effect of antiplatelet therapy and is potentially life threatening. Identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding may help target antiplatelet therapy. Objective This study sought to identify existing prediction models for intracranial hemorrhage or major bleeding in patients on antiplatelet therapy and evaluate their performance in patients with cerebral ischemia. Methods We systematically searched PubMed and Embase for existing prediction models up to December 2014. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the CHARMS checklist. Prediction models were externally validated in the European Stroke Prevention Study 2, comprising 6602 patients with a TIA or ischemic stroke. We assessed discrimination and calibration of included prediction models. Results Five prediction models were identified, of which two were developed in patients with previous cerebral ischemia. Three studies assessed major bleeding, one studied intracerebral hemorrhage and one gastrointestinal bleeding. None of the studies met all criteria of good quality. External validation showed poor discriminative performance, with c-statistics ranging from 0.53 to 0.64 and poor calibration. Conclusion A limited number of prediction models is available that predict intracranial hemorrhage or major bleeding in patients on antiplatelet therapy. The methodological quality of the models varied, but was generally low. Predictive performance in patients with cerebral ischemia was poor. In order to reliably predict the risk of bleeding in patients with cerebral ischemia, development of a prediction model according to current methodological standards is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to determine the proportion of patients with potentially operable non-small cell lung cancer that could be spared thoracotomy by a systematic search for extrathoracic metastases. METHODS: An English language literature search was carried out using MEDLINE (1966-91) and bibliographic reviews of textbooks, review articles, and key articles. Studies were included in which at least 90\% of the patients had histologically proven non-small cell cancer of the lung, were presumed otherwise operable, and for which the results of computed tomography of the head or abdomen, ultrasonography of the abdomen, or radionuclide imaging (scan) of bone or liver were available. Study quality and specific descriptive information concerning population, intervention, and outcome measurements were assessed. RESULTS: Of approximately 1500 citations which were screened, 100 were reviewed in detail and data abstracted from 16. The number of patients (total number, followed in square brackets by number of asymptomatic patients) shown to be inoperable directly as a result of the investigation and thus spared unnecessary thoracotomy was: computed tomography of the head: 26/785 (3.3\%), 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.1\% to 4.4\% [14/353 (4.0\%), 95\% CI 2\% to 6\%], computed tomography of the adrenal glands: 30/632 (4.7\%), 95\% CI 3.0\% to 6.4\% [number asymptomatic indeterminate], bone scan: 45/480 (9.3\%), 95\% CI 6.7\% to 12\% [9/301 (3.0\%), 95\% CI 1.1\% to 4.9\%], liver imaging: 12/529 (2.3\%), 95\% CI 0.9\% to 3.3\% [4/268 (1.5\%), 95\% CI 0.1\% to 3\%]. CONCLUSIONS: A study with a large sample size and preferably incorporating thoracic computed tomography is required to narrow the confidence intervals around each test. All tests may play an important part in the preoperative evaluation of patients with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung who are presumed to be operable, including asymptomatic patients. Limitations of present data preclude definitive recommendations for asymptomatic patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To determine if radiomic measures of tumor heterogeneity derived from baseline contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) are associated with durable clinical benefit and time to off-treatment in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (OC) enrolled in prospective immunotherapeutic trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 75 patients with recurrent OC who were enrolled in prospective immunotherapeutic trials (n = 74) or treated off-label (n = 1) and had baseline CE-CT scans. Disease burden (total tumor volume, number of disease sites), radiomic measures of intertumor heterogeneity (cluster-site entropy, cluster-site dissimilarity), and intratumor heterogeneity of the largest lesion (Haralick texture features) were computed. Associations of clinical, conventional imaging, and radiomic measures with durable clinical benefit and time to off-treatment were examined. RESULTS In univariable analysis, fewer disease sites, lower intertumor heterogeneity (lower cluster-site entropy, lower cluster-site dissimilarity), and lower intratumor heterogeneity of the largest lesion (higher energy) were significantly associated with durable clinical benefit (P ≤ .031). More disease sites, presence of pleural disease and/or distant metastases, higher intertumor heterogeneity (higher cluster-site entropy, higher cluster-site dissimilarity), and higher intratumor heterogeneity of the largest lesion (higher Contrastlargest-lesion) were significantly associated with shorter time to off-treatment (P ≤ .034). In multivariable analysis, higher Energylargest-lesion (indicator of lower intratumor heterogeneity; P = .006; odds ratio, 1.41) and fewer disease sites (P = .003; odds ratio, 1.64) remained significant indicators of durable clinical benefit (multivariable model C-index, 0.821). Higher cluster-site dissimilarity (indicator of higher intertumor heterogeneity) was a modest but single independent indicator of shorter time to off-treatment (P = .004; hazard ratio, 1.19; C-index, 0.6). CONCLUSION Fewer disease sites and lower intra- and intertumor heterogeneity modeled from the baseline CE-CT may indicate better response of OC to immunotherapy.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To derive a new cardiovascular disease risk score (QRISK) for the United Kingdom and to validate its performance against the established Framingham cardiovascular disease algorithm and a newly developed Scottish score (ASSIGN). DESIGN: Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from general practice. SETTING: UK practices contributing to the QRESEARCH database. PARTICIPANTS: The derivation cohort consisted of 1.28 million patients, aged 35-74 years, registered at 318 practices between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007 and who were free of diabetes and existing cardiovascular disease. The validation cohort consisted of 0.61 million patients from 160 practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First recorded diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (incident diagnosis between 1 January 1995 and 1 April 2007): myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic attacks. Risk factors were age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol to high density lipoprotein, body mass index, family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative aged less than 60, area measure of deprivation, and existing treatment with antihypertensive agent. RESULTS: A cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (QRISK) was developed in the derivation cohort. In the validation cohort the observed 10 year risk of a cardiovascular event was 6.60\% (95\% confidence interval 6.48\% to 6.72\%) in women and 9.28\% (9.14\% to 9.43\%) in men. Overall the Framingham algorithm over-predicted cardiovascular disease risk at 10 years by 35\%, ASSIGN by 36\%, and QRISK by 0.4\%. Measures of discrimination tended to be higher for QRISK than for the Framingham algorithm and it was better calibrated to the UK population than either the Framingham or ASSIGN models. Using QRISK 8.5\% of patients aged 35-74 are at high risk (20\% risk or higher over 10 years) compared with 13\% when using the Framingham algorithm and 14\% when using ASSIGN. Using QRISK 34\% of women and 73\% of men aged 64-75 would be at high risk compared with 24\% and 86\% according to the Framingham algorithm. UK estimates for 2005 based on QRISK give 3.2 million patients aged 35-74 at high risk, with the Framingham algorithm predicting 4.7 million and ASSIGN 5.1 million. Overall, 53 668 patients in the validation dataset (9\% of the total) would be reclassified from high to low risk or vice versa using QRISK compared with the Framingham algorithm. CONCLUSION: QRISK performed at least as well as the Framingham model for discrimination and was better calibrated to the UK population than either the Framingham model or ASSIGN. QRISK is likely to provide more appropriate risk estimates to help identify high risk patients on the basis of age, sex, and social deprivation. It is therefore likely to be a more equitable tool to inform management decisions and help ensure treatments are directed towards those most likely to benefit. It includes additional variables which improve risk estimates for patients with a positive family history or those on antihypertensive treatment. However, since the validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a "home advantage." Further validation in other populations is therefore required.},

Here, we derive and externally validate a new algorithm, which we have named QR4, that incorporates novel risk factors to estimate 10-year CVD risk separately for men and women. Health data from 9.98 million and 6.79 million adults from the United Kingdom were used for derivation and validation of the algorithm, respectively. Cause-specific Cox models were used to develop models to predict CVD risk, and the performance of QR4 was compared with version 3 of QRISK, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation 2 (SCORE2) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scores. We identified seven novel risk factors in models for both men and women (brain cancer, lung cancer, Down syndrome, blood cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, oral cancer and learning disability) and two additional novel risk factors in women (pre-eclampsia and postnatal depression). On external validation, QR4 had a higher C\,statistic than QRISK3 in both women (0.835 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.833–0.837) and 0.831 (95\% CI, 0.829–0.832) for QR4 and QRISK3, respectively) and men (0.814 (95\% CI, 0.812–0.816) and 0.812 (95\% CI, 0.810–0.814) for QR4 and QRISK3, respectively). QR4 was also more accurate than the ASCVD and SCORE2 risk scores in both men and women. The QR4 risk score identifies new risk groups and provides superior CVD risk prediction in the United Kingdom compared with other international scoring systems for CVD risk.},

Risk factors considered included those already in QRISK2 (age, ethnicity, deprivation, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol: high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, smoking, family history of coronary heart disease in a first degree relative aged less than 60 years, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, treated hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (stage 4 or 5)) and new risk factors (chronic kidney disease (stage 3, 4, or 5), a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and HIV/AIDs). We also considered erectile dysfunction diagnosis or treatment in men. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status. Main outcome measures Incident cardiovascular disease recorded on any of the following three linked data sources: general practice, mortality, or hospital admission records. Results 363 565 incident cases of cardiovascular disease were identified in the derivation cohort during follow-up arising from 50.8 million person years of observation. All new risk factors considered met the model inclusion criteria except for HIV/AIDS, which was not statistically significant. The models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the algorithm explained 59.6\% of the variation in time to diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (R2, with higher values indicating more variation), and the D statistic was 2.48 and Harrell’s C statistic was 0.88 (both measures of discrimination, with higher values indicating better discrimination). The corresponding values for men were 54.8\%, 2.26, and 0.86. Overall performance of the updated QRISK3 algorithms was similar to the QRISK2 algorithms. Conclusion Updated QRISK3 risk prediction models were developed and validated. The inclusion of additional clinical variables in QRISK3 (chronic kidney disease, a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, SLE, atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and erectile dysfunction) can help enable doctors to identify those at most risk of heart disease and stroke.},

Design~Cohort study.Setting~General practices in England providing data for the QResearch database linked to the national cancer registry.Participants~44\,145 patients aged 15-99 with colorectal cancer from 947 practices to derive the equations. The equations were validated in 15\,214 patients with colorectal cancer from 305 different QResearch practices and 437\,821 patients with colorectal cancer from the national cancer registry.Main outcome measures~The primary outcome was all cause mortality and secondary outcome was colorectal cancer mortality.Methods~Cause specific hazards models were used to predict risks of colorectal cancer mortality and other cause mortality accounting for competing risks, and these risk estimates were combined to obtain risks of all cause mortality. Separate equations were derived for men and women. Several variables were tested: age, ethnicity, deprivation score, cancer stage, cancer grade, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index, family history of bowel cancer, anaemia, liver function test result, comorbidities, use of statins, use of aspirin, clinical values for anaemia, and platelet count. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in both validation cohorts at 1, 5, and 10 years.Results~The final models included the following variables in men and women: age, deprivation score, cancer stage, cancer grade, smoking status, colorectal surgery, chemotherapy, family history of bowel cancer, raised platelet count, abnormal liver function, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prescribed aspirin at diagnosis, and prescribed statins at diagnosis. Improved survival in women was associated with younger age, earlier stage of cancer, well or moderately differentiated cancer grade, colorectal cancer surgery (adjusted hazard ratio 0.50), family history of bowel cancer (0.62), and prescriptions for statins (0.77) and aspirin (0.83) at diagnosis, with comparable results for men. The risk equations were well calibrated, with predicted risks closely matching observed risks. Discrimination was good in men and women in both validation cohorts. For example, the five year survival equations on the QResearch validation cohort explained 45.3\% of the variation in time to colorectal cancer death for women, the D statistic was 1.86, and Harrell's C statistic was 0.80 (both measures of discrimination, indicating that the scores are able to distinguish between people with different levels of risk). The corresponding results for all cause mortality were 42.6\%, 1.77, and 0.79.Conclusions~Risk prediction equations were developed and validated to estimate overall and conditional survival of patients with colorectal cancer accounting for an individual's clinical and demographic characteristics. These equations can provide more individualised accurate information for patients with colorectal cancer to inform decision making and follow-up.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Single-station N2 (Stage IIIA) non-small-cell lung cancer has been reported to have a relatively favorable prognosis after surgery. However, most  previous studies examined surgical outcomes in N2 disease by pathologic nodal status  but not by clinical nodal status. The objective of this study was to clarify the  surgical outcomes in clinical single-station N2 non-small-cell lung cancer patients.  METHODS: A total of 125 consecutive patients with clinical single-station N2  non-small-cell lung cancer were treated in our institution between 1992 and 2008.  Among them, 97 (78\%) patients underwent thoracotomy, and were included in this  retrospective study. We defined clinical single-station N2 node as a node measuring  1-2 cm in a single mediastinal station observed on contrast-enhanced computed  tomography. The median follow-up period was 5.9 years (range, 1.8-12.6). RESULTS:  Eighty-eight (91\%) patients underwent lung resection. Of them, 17 (19\%) had true  (pathologic) single-station N2 disease. Twenty-eight (32\%) had pathologic  multistation N2 and 43 (49\%) had pN0-1 disease with favorable prognoses. The overall  survival of the clinical single-station N2/pathologic N2 patients after initial  surgery was unsatisfactory with a 5-year overall survival of 23.6\%, but their  prognoses were heterogeneous. True single-station pathologic N2 status (hazard ratio  = 0.35, P = 0.008) and negative subcarinal node status (hazard ratio = 0.34, P =  0.022) were independent favorable prognostic factors after initial resection for  clinical single-station N2/ pathologic N2 patients. The patients with both factors  revealed a relatively favorable 5-year overall survival of 43.8\%. CONCLUSION:  Clinical single-station N2 status does not always correspond with pathologic true N2  status. From a prognostic point of view, initial surgery for clinical single-station  N2 patients is indicated if their true single-station N2 status and negative  subcarinal involvement are preoperatively confirmed.},

  abstract = {We performed a two-part study to determine the roles of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and the vasoconstrictor nerves neurotransmitters noradrenaline (NA) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the cutaneous vasodilator response to local skin warming. Forearm skin sites were instrumented with intradermal microdialysis fibres, local heaters, and laser-Doppler flow (LDF) probes. Sites were locally heated from 34 to 42°C. LDF was expressed as cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; LDF/mean arterial pressure). In Part I, we tested whether sympathetic noradrenergic nerves acted via eNOS. In 8 male participants, treatments were as follows: 1) untreated; 2) bretylium tosylate (BT), preventing sympathetic neurotransmitter release; 3) l-NAA to inhibit eNOS; and 4) combined BT+l-NAA. At treated sites, the initial peak response was markedly reduced, and the plateau phase response to 35min of local warming was also reduced (P{$<$}0.05), which was not different among those sites (P{$>$}0.05). In Part II, we tested whether NA and NPY were involved in the vasodilator response to local warming. In Part IIa, treatments were: 1) untreated; 2) propranolol and yohimbine to antagonize α- and β-receptors; 3) l-NAA; and 4) combined propranolol, yohimbine, and l-NAA. In Part IIb, conditions were: 1) untreated; 2) BIBP to antagonize Y1-receptors; 3) l-NAA; and 4) combined BIBP and l-NAA. All treatments caused a reduction in the initial peak and plateau responses to local skin warming (P{$<$}0.05). The results of Part II indicate that both NA and NPY play roles in the cutaneous vasodilator response and their actions are achieved via eNOS. These data indicate that NA and NPY are involved in the initial, rapid rise in skin blood flow at the onset of local skin warming. However, their vasodilator actions in response to local skin warming appears to be manifested through eNOS.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{\textbackslash epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{\textbackslash epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether music improves recovery after surgical procedures. Methods We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients undergoing surgical procedures, excluding those involving the central nervous system or head and neck, published in any language. We included RCTs in which any form of music initiated before, during, or after surgery was compared with standard care or other non-drug interventions. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central. We did meta-analysis with RevMan (version 5.2), with standardised mean differences (SMD) and random-effects models, and used Stata (version 12) for meta-regression. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42013005220. Findings We identified 4261 titles and abstracts, and included 73 RCTs in the systematic review, with size varying between 20 and 458 participants. Choice of music, timing, and duration varied. Comparators included routine care, headphones with no music, white noise, and undisturbed bed rest. Music reduced postoperative pain (SMD −0·77 [95\% CI −0·99 to −0·56]), anxiety (−0·68 [–0·95 to −0·41]), and analgesia use (−0·37 [–0·54 to −0·20]), and increased patient satisfaction (1·09 [0·51 to 1·68]), but length of stay did not differ (SMD −0·11 [–0·35 to 0·12]). Subgroup analyses showed that choice of music and timing of delivery made little difference to outcomes. Meta-regression identified no causes of heterogeneity in eight variables assessed. Music was effective even when patients were under general anaesthetic. Interpretation Music could be offered as a way to help patients reduce pain and anxiety during the postoperative period. Timing and delivery can be adapted to individual clinical settings and medical teams. Funding None.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the prediction of individualized treatment effects. While there is a rapidly growing literature on the development of such models, there is little literature on the evaluation of their performance. In this paper, we aim to facilitate the validation of prediction models for individualized treatment effects. The estimands of interest are defined based on the potential outcomes framework, which facilitates a comparison of existing and novel measures. In particular, we examine existing measures of discrimination for benefit (variations of the c‐for‐benefit), and propose model‐based extensions to the treatment effect setting for discrimination and calibration metrics that have a strong basis in outcome risk prediction. The main focus is on randomized trial data with binary endpoints and on models that provide individualized treatment effect predictions and potential outcome predictions. We use simulated data to provide insight into the characteristics of the examined discrimination and calibration statistics under consideration, and further illustrate all methods in a trial of acute ischemic stroke treatment. The results show that the proposed model‐based statistics had the best characteristics in terms of bias and accuracy. While resampling methods adjusted for the optimism of performance estimates in the development data, they had a high variance across replications that limited their accuracy. Therefore, individualized treatment effect models are best validated in independent data. To aid implementation, a software implementation of the proposed methods was made available in               R               .},

  abstract = {Randomized trials typically estimate average relative treatment effects, but decisions on the benefit of a treatment are possibly better informed by more individualized predictions of the absolute treatment effect. In case of a binary outcome, these predictions of absolute individualized treatment effect require knowledge of the individual's risk without treatment and incorporation of a possibly differential treatment effect (ie, varying with patient characteristics). In this article, we lay out the causal structure of individualized treatment effect in terms of potential outcomes and describe the required assumptions that underlie a causal interpretation of its prediction. Subsequently, we describe regression models and model estimation techniques that can be used to move from average to more individualized treatment effect predictions. We focus mainly on logistic regression-based methods that are both well-known and naturally provide the required probabilistic estimates. We incorporate key components from both causal inference and prediction research to arrive at individualized treatment effect predictions. While the separate components are well known, their successful amalgamation is very much an ongoing field of research. We cut the problem down to its essentials in the setting of a randomized trial, discuss the importance of a clear definition of the estimand of interest, provide insight into the required assumptions, and give guidance with respect to modeling and estimation options. Simulated data illustrate the potential of different modeling options across scenarios that vary both average treatment effect and treatment effect heterogeneity. Two applied examples illustrate individualized treatment effect prediction in randomized trial data.},

This simple and robust technique has been used in a great many experimental and neuropathological studies; however, the function of this enzyme has remained a matter of speculation. We, therefore, undertook to characterize this enzyme biochemically. With biochemical and immunochemical assays, NADPH diaphorase was purified to apparent homogeneity from rat brain by affinity chromatography and anion-exchange HPLC. Western (immunoblot) transfer and immunostaining with an antibody specific for NADPH diaphorase labeled a single protein of 150 kDa. Nitric oxide synthase was recently shown to be a 150-kDa, NADPH-dependent enzyme in brain. It is responsible for the calcium/calmodulin-dependent synthesis of the guanylyl cyclase activator nitric oxide from L-arginine. We have found that nitric oxide synthase activity and NADPH diaphorase copurify to homogeneity and that both activities could be immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing neuronal NADPH diaphorase. Furthermore, nitric oxide synthase was competitively inhibited by the NADPH diaphorase substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium. Thus, neuronal NADPH diaphorase is a nitric oxide synthase, and NADPH diaphorase histochemistry, therefore, provides a specific histochemical marker for neurons producing nitric oxide.},

We review the association between BTS and OS/progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with a diagnosis of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with atezolizumab. METHODS: Data from 1,461 patients with a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC enrolled in the OAK, POPLAR, BIRCH, and FIR trials and treated with atezolizumab were pooled and analyzed. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we modeled the association between baseline SLD and survival outcomes. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for pretreatment ECOG PS, age, sex, race, smoking status, histology, count of prior treatments, PDL1 expression, serum LDH levels, and the presence of liver, lung, or brain lesions. RESULTS: On univariable and multivariable analysis, baseline sum of the longest diameters of target lesions (SLD) was identified as significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval] per decimeter: 1.64 [1.41-1.91], P {$<$} .001) and PFS (1.21 [1.07-1.38], P\,=\,.003). Median OS were 16 months versus 10 months for baseline SLD {$<$} median, versus baseline SLD ≥ median, respectively. Median PFS were 4 months versus 3 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Large BTS was identified as an independent prognostic factor of worse OS and PFS, raising the need to evaluate atezolizumab as an earlier NSCLC treatment in future trials.},

The long-term feasibility and efficacy of  vinorelbine and cisplatin with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy were investigated.  Eighteen patients received cisplatin (80 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and vinorelbine (20  mg/m(2) in level 1, and 25 mg/m(2) in level 2) on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks for  four cycles in a phase I trial. Ninety-three patients received the same chemotherapy  regimen except for the fixed vinorelbine (20 mg/m(2)) dosage and consolidation  therapy with docetaxel (60 mg/m(2), every 3 weeks). The thoracic radiotherapy  consisted of a single dose of 2 Gy once daily to a total dose of 60 Gy. A total of  111 patients were analyzed in the present study: male/female, 91/20; median age, 60  years; stage IIIA/IIIB, 50/61; and squamous/non-squamous histology, 26/85. The 3-,  5-, and 7-year overall survival rates (95\% CI) were 43.2\% (33.9-52.2), 25.2\%  (17.6-33.5), and 23.2\% (15.8-31.4), respectively.

  abstract = {Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasing problem in Canada and worldwide. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are strains of Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis that contain genes conferring resistance to vancomycin. Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia), and other gram-negative bacteria may produce the enzymes known as extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). These have the ability to inactivate beta lactam antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, and the cephalosporins. The presence and growth (colonization) of VRE and ESBL-producing micro-organisms in the gastrointestinal tract is usually of no consequence for the host, but under certain circumstances, such as immunosuppression, gastrointestinal surgery, or physical debilitation, they may serve as a source of infection for the carrier. These hosts may also serve as a reservoir for the transmission of VRE and ESBL-producing organisms to other persons. Results from the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program showed that from 1999 to 2005, the rate of VRE colonization and VRE infection increased from 0.37 to 1.32 cases, and from 0.02 to 0.05 cases respectively per 1,000 patients admitted to hospital. The laboratory-based Canadian Ward Surveillance Study in 2008 found that ESBL-producing E. coli were identified in all Canadian geographic regions, and that 4.9\% of E. coli isolates were ESBL producers. Specific prevention and control measures for antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) include screening (a process to identify persons colonized with AROs) and isolation of the carriers. Hospital infection prevention and control strategies have been developed in some Canadian jurisdictions, and these are compatible with other national and international documents. Non-specific strategies for controlling ARO transmission and infection include hand hygiene; environmental cleaning; antimicrobial stewardship; and bundled practices, such as those to prevent central line-associated blood stream infections. Antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as VRE and ESBL-producers, lead to the increased use of hospital resources due to extended hospital stays, laboratory tests, physician consultations, costly medications if therapy for a VRE or ESBL-related infection were to arise, and the need to adhere to infection prevention and control measures to prevent the further spread of these pathogens. Some of the increased resource usage results from the morbidity caused by VRE or ESBL-producing organism infections, while some is a consequence of control strategies. For example, it may be harder to transfer a patient to a rehabilitation facility if they are currently in isolation, which will in and of itself, prolong the length of stay. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the clinical evidence for the effectiveness of screening, isolation, and decolonization strategies for persons colonized or infected with VRE and ESBL-producing organisms in acute and long-term care facilities. The health services impact of these strategies will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Background Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often demonstrate varying clinical courses and outcomes, even within the same tumor stage. This study explores deep learning applications in medical imaging allowing for the automated quantification of radiographic characteristics and potentially improving patient stratification. Methods and findings We performed an integrative analysis on 7 independent datasets across 5 institutions totaling 1,194 NSCLC patients (age median = 68.3 years [range 32.5–93.3], survival median = 1.7 years [range 0.0–11.7]). Using external validation in computed tomography (CT) data, we identified prognostic signatures using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for patients treated with radiotherapy (n = 771, age median = 68.0 years [range 32.5–93.3], survival median = 1.3 years [range 0.0–11.7]). We then employed a transfer learning approach to achieve the same for surgery patients (n = 391, age median = 69.1 years [range 37.2–88.0], survival median = 3.1 years [range 0.0–8.8]). We found that the CNN predictions were significantly associated with 2-year overall survival from the start of respective treatment for radiotherapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.70 [95\% CI 0.63–0.78], p {$<$} 0.001) and surgery (AUC = 0.71 [95\% CI 0.60–0.82], p {$<$} 0.001) patients. The CNN was also able to significantly stratify patients into low and high mortality risk groups in both the radiotherapy (p {$<$} 0.001) and surgery (p = 0.03) datasets. Additionally, the CNN was found to significantly outperform random forest models built on clinical parameters—including age, sex, and tumor node metastasis stage—as well as demonstrate high robustness against test–retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91) and inter-reader (Spearman’s rank-order correlation = 0.88) variations. To gain a better understanding of the characteristics captured by the CNN, we identified regions with the most contribution towards predictions and highlighted the importance of tumor-surrounding tissue in patient stratification. We also present preliminary findings on the biological basis of the captured phenotypes as being linked to cell cycle and transcriptional processes. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study as well as the opaque black box nature of deep learning networks. Conclusions Our results provide evidence that deep learning networks may be used for mortality risk stratification based on standard-of-care CT images from NSCLC patients. This evidence motivates future research into better deciphering the clinical and biological basis of deep learning networks as well as validation in prospective data.},

  abstract = {Circulating tumor cell (CTC) number in metastatic cancer patients yields prognostic information consistent with enhanced cell migration and invasion via loss of adhesion, a feature of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tumor cells also invade via collective migration with maintained cell-cell contacts and consistent with this is the circulating tumor microemboli (CTM; contiguous groups of tumor cells) that are observed in metastatic cancer patients. Using a blood filtration approach, we examined markers of EMT (cytokeratins, E-cadherin, vimentin, neural cadherin) and prevalence of apoptosis in CTCs and CTM to explore likely mechanism(s) of invasion in lung cancer patients and address the hypothesis that cells within CTM have a survival advantage. Intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity was observed for EMT markers in CTCs and CTM. Vimentin was only expressed in some CTCs, but in the majority of cells within CTM; E-cadherin expression was lost, cytoplasmic or nuclear, and rarely expressed at the surface of the cells within CTM. A subpopulation of CTCs was apoptotic, but apoptosis was absent within CTM. This pilot study suggests that EMT is not prosecuted homogeneously in tumor cells within the circulation of lung cancer patients and that collective migration and enhanced survival of cells within CTM might contribute to lung cancer metastasis. Multiplex analysis and further detailed exploration of metastatic potential and EMT in CTCs/CTM is now warranted in a larger patient cohort.},

  abstract = {Fine-tuning large pretrained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter’s effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 262626 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.80.80.8\% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.63.63.6\% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100100100\% of the parameters per task.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: Decision curve analysis (DCA) is a widely used method for evaluating diagnostic tests and predictive models. It was developed based on expected utility theory (EUT) and has been reformulated using expected regret theory (ERG). Under certain circumstances, these 2 formulations yield different results. Here we describe these situations and explain the variation. METHODS: We compare the derivations of the EUT- and ERG-based formulations of DCA for a typical medical decision problem: "treat none," "treat all," or "use model" to guide treatment. We illustrate the differences between the 2 formulations when applied to the following clinical question: at which probability of death we should refer a terminally ill patient to hospice? RESULTS: Both DCA formulations yielded identical but mirrored results when treatment effects are ignored; they generated significantly different results otherwise. Treatment effect has a significant effect on the results derived by EUT DCA and less so on ERG DCA. The elicitation of specific values for disutilities affected the results even more significantly in the context of EUT DCA, whereas no such elicitation was required within the ERG framework. CONCLUSION: EUT and ERG DCA generate different results when treatment effects are taken into account. The magnitude of the difference depends on the effect of treatment and the disutilities associated with disease and treatment effects. This is important to realize as the current practice guidelines are uniformly based on EUT; the same recommendations can significantly differ if they are derived based on ERG framework.},

  abstract = {Despite the rising popularity of saliency-based explanations, the research community remains at an impasse, facing doubts concerning their purpose, efficacy, and tendency to contradict each other. Seeking to unite the community's efforts around common goals, several recent works have proposed evaluation metrics. In this paper, we critically examine two sets of metrics: the ERASER metrics (comprehensiveness and sufficiency) and the EVAL-X metrics, focusing our inquiry on natural language processing. First, we show that we can inflate a model's comprehensiveness and sufficiency scores dramatically without altering its predictions or explanations on in-distribution test inputs. Our strategy exploits the tendency for extracted explanations and their complements to be "out-of-support" relative to each other and in-distribution inputs. Next, we demonstrate that the EVAL-X metrics can be inflated arbitrarily by a simple method that encodes the label, even though EVAL-X is precisely motivated to address such exploits. Our results raise doubts about the ability of current metrics to guide explainability research, underscoring the need for a broader reassessment of what precisely these metrics are intended to capture.},

Four types of CM including ioxitalamate (high osmolar and ionic), ioxaglate (low osmolar and ionic), iohexol (low osmolar and nonionic), and iodixanol (iso-osmolar and nonionic) were given iv (1600 mg I/kg body weight) to urethane-anesthetized female Wistar rats. We measured RENA by electrophysiologic recording techniques, renal blood flow with Doppler ultrasound, PRA by radioimmunoassay, and ROS by an in vivo chemiluminescence method. We graded the severity of CM-induced vacuoles in cortical tubular cells stained by hematoxylin and eosin and apoptosis production in outer medulla by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Besides, the effects of pretreatment with iv beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight), antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg body weight), and renal denervation on CM-induced pathophysiologic parameters were determined. Ioxitalamate significantly increased RENA and renal vascular resistance, PRA, renal ROS production within 1 h, and formation of vacuoles and TUNEL apoptosis in renal tubular cells 2 h later; other CM had less effect on these parameters. On the other hand, propranolol, N-acetylcysteine, or renal denervation partially attenuated the ioxitalamate-aggravated responses on RENA, PRA, ROS production, and vacuole and TUNEL apoptosis formation in renal tubular cells. In conclusion, we suggest that ioxitalamate may induce acute tubular injury via aggravation of RENA, adrenergic signaling, PRA, and ROS production.}

We discuss two subtly different definitions of collapsibility, and show that by considering causal effect measures based on counterfactual variables (rather than measures of association based on observed variables) it is possible to separate out the component of non-collapsibility which is due to the mathematical properties of the effect measure, from the components that are due to structural bias such as confounding. We provide new weights such that the causal risk ratio is collapsible over arbitrary baseline covariates. In the absence of confounding, these weights may be used for standardization of the risk ratio.}

  abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

Of 655 patients referred for elective CABG surgery, 299 (45.6\%) met criteria for high risk of developing PPCs, of whom 279 were enrolled and followed up until discharge from hospital.Intervention~Patients were randomly assigned to receive either preoperative IMT (n~=~140) or usual care (n~=~139). Both groups received the same postoperative physical therapy.Main Outcome Measures~Incidence of PPCs, especially pneumonia, and duration of postoperative hospitalization.Results~Both groups were comparable at baseline. After CABG surgery, PPCs were present in 25 (18.0\%) of 139 patients in the IMT group and 48 (35.0\%) of 137 patients in the usual care group (odds ratio [OR], 0.52; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.92). Pneumonia occurred in 9 (6.5\%) of 139 patients in the IMT group and in 22 (16.1\%) of 137 patients in the usual care group (OR, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.84). Median duration of postoperative hospitalization was 7 days (range, 5-41 days) in the IMT group vs 8 days (range, 6-70 days) in the usual care group by Mann-Whitney U statistic (z~=~–2.42; P~=~.02).Conclusion~Preoperative IMT reduced the incidence of PPCs and duration of postoperative hospitalization in patients at high risk of developing a pulmonary complication undergoing CABG surgery.Trial Registration~isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN17691887}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated the role of computed tomography (CT)-guided Iodine-125 ((125)I) seed implantation in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of  stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data from  182 patients with stage III NSCLC who were treated with radioactive (125)I seed  implantation between June 2002 and June 2009, and who received sequential  platinum-based combination chemotherapy using the most common combination of  platinum and gemcitabine, were retrospectively reviewed. The 182 patients received a  prescribed dose of 110.0 Gy, with a median radioactivity of 0.70 mCi (range,  0.64-0.78 mCi, 2.37-3.26 × 107 Bq). The median number of (125)I seeds was 38 pellets  (range, 6-105 pellets). The median post-operation dose covering 100\% of the target  volume (D(100)) was 94.5 Gy (range, 54.6-125.5 Gy). The median D(90) was 143.0 Gy  (range, 121.6-184.0). RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were  83.35\%, 25.57\%, and 11.34\%, respectively; the median survival time was 24.76 months.  At 1, 3, and 5 years, the local control rates were 92.01\%, 86.51\%, and 76.45\%,  respectively; the median local control time was 25.28 months. For patients with  stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC, the median survival times were 26.67 and 24.59 months,  respectively (p = 0.2). Pre-treatment hemoglobin level, tumor volume, and  postoperative D(100) were significantly associated with survival. A total of 24  patients experienced pneumothorax (incidence rate, 13.20\%), and 17 patients  experienced hemothorax (incidence rate, 5.0\%). CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided (125)I seed  implantation combined with chemotherapy is an effective, minimally invasive method  for the treatment of stage III NSCLC. Furthermore, hemoglobin levels before  treatment, D(100), and the maximum diameter of the tumor may be prognostic factors  in patients with NSCLC treated sequentially with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.},

A preliminary study also suggested that ERCC1  expression is associated with radioresistance in lung cancer cells. The aim of this  study was to evaluate the clinical implications of ERCC1 expression in stage IIIA  N2-positive NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant concurrent  chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with  mediastinoscopy-proven N2-positive NSCLC were enrolled between August 1997 and  September 2003. ERCC1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry from  pretreatment mediastinoscopic biopsy specimens. RESULTS: ERCC1 expression was  positive in 31 of 68 specimens (46\%). Among 14 patients who obtained pathologic  complete response, 6 were positive for ERCC1 expression and 8 were negative (P =  .818). On univariate analysis, with median follow-up of 61.8 months (range,  34.3-108.8 months), progression-free survival was 15.9 months for ERCC1-positive and  29.5 months for ERCC1-negative patients (P = .062), and there was a statistically  significant difference in overall survival between ERCC1-negative tumors and  ERCC1-positive tumors (89.2 vs 26.0 months, P = .014). On multivariate analysis,  ERCC1 negativity (P = .041) and achieving mediastinal nodal clearance (downstage to  pathological N0 or N1) after neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery (P = .005) were  significant independent prognostic factors for the prolongation of survival.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that N2-positive NSCLC patients with ERCC1  negative tumors show a survival benefit from neoadjuvant CCRT with a  platinum-containing regimen.},

METHODS: We  reviewed 194 consecutive patients with stage IIIA NSCLC treated with surgical  resection (surgical group) and 115 patients treated with nonsurgical therapy  (nonsurgical group: 50 stage IIIA, 65 stage IIIB). Metabolic tumour volume (MTV),  total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of  primary tumours were measured using pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT. Overall survival  was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prognostic significance of PET  parameters and other clinical variables was assessed using Cox proportional hazards  regression analyses. To evaluate and compare the predictive performance of PET  parameters, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis  was used. RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazards models, MTV (HR=1.27 for a  doubling of MTV, P=0.008) and TLG (HR=1.22 for a doubling of TLG, P=0.035) were  significantly associated with an increased risk of death after adjusting for age,  gender, histological cell type, T stage, N stage, and treatment variables in the  surgical group. SUVmax was not a significant prognostic factor in either the  surgical or nonsurgical group. In the time-dependent ROC curve analysis,  volume-based PET parameters predicted survival better than SUVmax. CONCLUSION: The  volume-based PET parameters (MTV and TLG) are significant prognostic factors for  survival independent of tumour stage and better prognostic imaging biomarkers than  SUVmax in patients with stage IIIA NSCLC after surgical resection.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 161  consecutive patients who had stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant CCRT  followed by surgery. In all cases, N2 disease was pathologically confirmed by  mediastinoscopic biopsy, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle  aspiration, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We measured the total metabolic  tumor volume (total MTV) and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax),  including a primary tumor and metastatic nodes on the pretreatment scan. Overall  survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier  method. The association of PET parameters with OS and DFS was determined by  univariable and multivariable analyses performed using the Cox regression model.  RESULTS: A higher total MTV was significantly associated with poor DFS (hazard ratio  [HR], 1.82; p = 0.036) and OS (HR = 2.97; p = 0.012) in the multivariable analysis.  In contrast, a higher SUVmax was not significantly associated with poor DFS and OS.  Patients with a high total MTV ({$>$} 22 cm(3)) had a median survival time that was  significantly shorter than that of patients with a low total MTV (median DFS, 11.3  vs 42.0 months, respectively [p {$<$} 0.001]; median OS, 38.3 months vs not reached [p {$<$}  0.001]). Kaplan-Meier curves showed significant differences on the basis of total  MTV in patients with or without mediastinal downstaging after CCRT. Patients with a  high total MTV had significantly worse DFS when they had post-neoadjuvant pathologic  (yp) stage 0-II disease (p = 0.020) or yp stage III disease (p = 0.036). Higher  total MTV was also associated with worse OS in patients with yp stage 0-II disease  (p = 0.013) or yp stage III disease (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: A higher pretreatment  total MTV is associated with worse outcome, independent of yp stage, in patients  with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear ICA is a fundamental problem for unsupervised representation learning, emphasizing the capacity to recover the underlying latent variables generating the data (i.e., identifiability). Recently, the very first identifiability proofs for nonlinear ICA have been proposed, leveraging the temporal structure of the independent components. Here, we propose a general framework for nonlinear ICA, which, as a special case, can make use of temporal structure. It is based on augmenting the data by an auxiliary variable, such as the time index, the history of the time series, or any other available information. We propose to learn nonlinear ICA by discriminating between true augmented data, or data in which the auxiliary variable has been randomized. This enables the framework to be implemented algorithmically through logistic regression, possibly in a neural network. We provide a comprehensive proof of the identifiability of the model as well as the consistency of our estimation method. The approach not only provides a general theoretical framework combining and generalizing previously proposed nonlinear ICA models and algorithms, but also brings practical advantages.},

Nitric oxide (NO) produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, NOS-I) might play a dynamic role in the control of vascular tone. This study was performed to verify, by immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses, the presence and expression of nNOS and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) in SSc skin, in different subsets and various phases of the disease.MethodsBiopsy samples of clinically involved skin from 32 SSc patients (12 with limited cutaneous SSc [lcSSc] and 20 with the diffuse form [dcSSc]) and skin samples from 6 healthy controls were either immunostained with anti–PGP 9.5 and anti-nNOS antibodies or analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.ResultsImmunohistochemical and biochemical data showed a decrease in PGP 9.5 and nNOS innervation and in their messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in lcSSc and dcSSc skin. In the edematous phase of SSc, a light alteration in cutaneous innervation was initiated and slowly progressed into the sclerotic phase, becoming most evident in the atrophic phase. Levels of nNOS mRNA were significantly lower between the edematous phase and the sclerotic phase in both dcSSc and lcSSc skin, which was attributable to the earlier occurrence of more severe pathologic alterations.ConclusionTotal cutaneous innervation and nNOS innervation slowly disappear in the skin of SSc patients. Expression of nNOS depends on the severity of tissue damage in SSc, and increased synthesis of NO also contributes to this process. It remains to be determined whether the changes in cutaneous innervation are due to the disease itself or whether these changes contribute to the pathogenesis and evolution of SSc.},

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. Methods We analyzed the clinicopathological data of 44 cases of advanced NSCLC targeted with ICIs in our hospital, between February 2016 and February 2018, in order to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. We also reviewed the literature regarding ICIs. Result We retrospectively analyzed the 44 cases (26 nivolumab and 18 pembrolizumab cases). These patients were 38 men and 6 women, comprising 13 cases of adenocarcinoma, 29 squamous cell carcinoma and 2 unclassified types. Seven patients were using first-line therapy and while the others were using second-line therapy or later. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations were negative in all the cases. The response rate and disease control rate were 20.5\% and 51.3\%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 146 days and 257 days, respectively. We observed five severe adverse effects (AEs) (three cases of interstitial pneumonia, one of liver dysfunction and one of adrenal failure), that were resolved by steroid pulse therapy. In multivariate analyses, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), pathological type, standardized uptake value (SUV) on positron emission tomography (PET), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin were independently prognostic factors. There were no significant differences in the prognosis between nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Conclusions ICIs were effective in 44 treated NSCLC cases. Our analysis suggests that while ICIs are effective in treating patients, candidates must be carefully selected and cautiously observed.},

  abstract = {1. Chronic electrical stimulation of the carotid sinuses has provided unique insight into the mechanisms that cause sustained reductions in blood pressure during chronic suppression of central sympathetic outflow. 2. Because renal denervation does not abolish the sustained fall in arterial pressure in response to baroreflex activation, this observation has seemingly challenged the concept that the kidneys play a critical role in the long-term control of arterial pressure during chronic changes in sympathetic activity. The aim of the present study was to use computer simulations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of physiological mechanisms that mediate sustained reductions in arterial pressure during prolonged baroreflex-mediated suppression of central sympathetic outflow. 3. Physiological responses to baroreflex activation under different conditions were simulated by an established mathematical model of human physiology (QHP2008; see Supporting Information (Appendix S1) provided in the online version of this article and/or http://groups.google.com/group/modelingworkshop). The model closely reproduced empirical data, providing important validation of its accuracy. 4. The simulations indicated that baroreflex-mediated suppression of renal sympathetic nerve activity does chronically increase renal excretory function but that, in addition, hormonal and haemodynamic mechanisms also contribute to this natriuretic response. The contribution of these redundant natriuretic mechanisms to the chronic lowering of blood pressure is of increased importance when suppression of renal adrenergic activity is prevented, such as after renal denervation. Activation of these redundant natriuretic mechanisms occurs at the expense of excessive fluid retention. 5. More broadly, the present study illustrates the value of numerical simulations in elucidating physiological mechanisms that are not obvious intuitively and, in some cases, not readily testable in experimental studies.}

Methods We retrospectively assessed 37 patients who had measurable tumor lesions. PTS and post-treatment tumor size were defined as the sum of the size in all measurable lesions. Results In univariate analysis, PTS below 42~mm, history of radiation therapy, and no use of cetuximab were significantly associated with longer PFS. Among them, small-PTS was an independent predictive factor for PFS in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio: 0.33, p~=~0.022). In addition, significantly greater tumor shrinkage was observed for small-PTS than large-PTS (median: −10.0\% vs. 23.1\%, p~=~0.033).

  abstract = {Ischemia-reperfusion injury during renal transplantation has been linked to early graft dysfunction and late graft failure. Nitric oxide (NO), produced by NO synthase (NOS), participates in the recovery from ischemia. We correlated the intensity of graft immunoreactivity for the endothelial NOS isoform (eNOS) during early reperfusion with graft function in 25 children receiving grafts from related donors. Renal allograft biopsy specimens were obtained before transplantation, 1 h after renal artery reperfusion, and 1 year after transplantation. Immunohistochemical staining for eNOS occurred mainly within the endothelium of glomerular capillaries and peritubular capillaries as well as in tubule cells. The mean intensity score for eNOS staining (0-9) was 3.0+/-1.4 before transplantation, 4.5+/-1.9 at 1 h, and 3.3+/-1.9 at 1 year (baseline vs 1 h, P{$<$}0.05). Creatinine clearance (ml/min) in patients with a 1-h eNOS score of below 5 and of at least 5, respectively, was 77.1+/-28.4 vs 104.3+/-25.3 at 1 month, 78.7+/-33.4 vs 105.2+/-24.4 at 3 months, 64.7+/-30.1 vs 100.1+/-25.3 at 1 year, 58.2+/-31.3 vs 84.7+/-18.8 at 3 years, and 71.2+/-19.7 vs 78.3+/-23.1 at 5 years ( P{$<$}0.05 for 1 month, 1 year, and 3 years). We concluded that elevated eNOS expression after reperfusion in living related-donor renal transplantation enhances the recovery from renal ischemia and, consequently, reduces late graft deterioration.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Cancer cachexia affects many advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Cachexia index (CXI) was developed to assess the degree of cachexia in these patients. Methods: Patients with metastatic NSCLC diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2011, at our institution were retrospectively studied. Abdominal computed tomography scans done within 1 month of diagnosis were reviewed to estimate skeletal muscle area (SMA) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the L3 level. CXI was developed as follows: CXI=(SMI × Alb)/NLR where SMI is the skeletal muscle index, Alb is the serum albumin, and NLR is the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Survival among various factors was calculated using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to perform survival analysis in order to estimate the effects of various factors. Results: Patients were divided into two groups around the median into stage I cachexia (CXI ≥35, n = 56) and stage II cachexia (CXI {$<$}35, n = 56). Groups did not differ in age, gender, ethnicity, or histology of cancer. Patients with stage II cachexia had significantly worse PFS (2.45 vs 5.43 months, P {$<$} 0.0001) and OS (3.45 vs 8.8 months, P = 0.0001) than those with stage I cachexia. On multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, race, and histology, patients with stage II cachexia were found to have worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.27–2.95) and OS (HR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.0009–2.34). Conclusion: The CXI is a novel index for estimating cachexia that also correlates with prognosis in both men and women with advanced NSCLC. © the authors, publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Limited.},

In practice, there can be substantial uncertainty about the distribution of new data, and corresponding variability in the performance of existing predictors. Building on the theory of partial identification and transportability, this paper introduces new results for bounding the value of a functional of the target distribution, such as the generalization error of a classifiers, given data from source domains and assumptions about the data generating mechanisms, encoded in causal diagrams. Our contribution is to provide the first general estimation technique for transportability problems, adapting existing parameterization schemes such Neural Causal Models to encode the structural constraints necessary for cross-population inference. We demonstrate the expressiveness and consistency of this procedure and further propose a gradient-based optimization scheme for making scalable inferences in practice. Our results are corroborated with experiments.},

  abstract = {Patients with kidney disease have an uncertain future, with prognosis varying greatly per patient. To get a better idea of what the future holds and tailor interventions to the individual patient, prediction models can be of great value. Before a prediction model can be applied in practice, its performance should be measured in target populations of interest (i.e. external validation) and whether or not it helps improve clinical practice (i.e. whether it impacts clinical practice) should be determined. The impact would ideally be determined using an impact trial, but such a trial is often not feasible, and the impact of prediction models is therefore rarely assessed. As a result, prediction models that may not be so impactful may end up in clinical practice and impactful models may not be implemented due to a lack of impact studies. Ultimately, many prediction models end up never being implemented, resulting in much research waste. To allow researchers to get an indication of a prediction model's impact on clinical practice, alternative methods to assess a prediction model's impact are important. In this paper, we discuss several alternatives, including interviews, case-based surveys, decision comparisons, outcome modelling, before–after analyses and decision curve analyses. We discuss the general idea behind these approaches, including what information can be gathered from such studies and important pitfalls. Lastly, we provide examples of the different alternatives.}

  abstract = {Background:Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are emerging worldwide, representing a major threat for public health. Early CPE detection is crucial in order to prevent infections and the development of reservoirs/outbreaks in hospitals. In 2008, most of the CPE strains reported in Belgium were imported from patients repatriated from abroad. Actually, this is no longer the case.Objectives and methods:A surveillance was set up in Belgian hospitals (2012) in order to explore the epidemiology and determinants of CPE, including the link with international travel/hospitalization. The present article describes travel-related CPE reported in Belgium. Different other potential sources for importation of CPE are discussed.Results:Only 12\% of all CPE cases reported in Belgium (2012–2013) were travel related (with/without hospitalization). This is undoubtedly an underestimation (missing travel data: 36\%), considering the increasing tourism, the immigration from endemic countries, the growing number of foreign patients using scheduled medical care in Belgium, and the medical repatriations from foreign hospitals. The free movement of persons and services (European Union) contributes to an increase in foreign healthcare workers (HCW) in Belgian hospitals. Residents from nursing homes located at the country borders can be another potential source of dissemination of CPE between countries. Moreover, the high population density in Belgium can increase the risk for CPE-dissemination. Urban areas in Belgium may cumulate these potential risk factors for import/dissemination of CPE.Conclusions:Ideally, travel history data should be obtained from hospital hygiene teams, not from the microbiological laboratory. Patients who received medical care abroad (whatever the country) should be screened for CPE at admission.},

A quantitative imaging feature (QIF) on positron emission tomography (PET), gray-level co-occurrence matrix energy, has been linked with outcome of nonmetastatic NSCLC. We hypothesized that GLCM energy would enhance the ability of models comprising standard clinical prognostic factors (CPFs) to stratify oligometastatic patients based on overall survival (OS). Materials and methods We assessed 79 patients with oligometastatic NSCLC (≤3 metastases) diagnosed in 2007–2015. The primary and largest metastases at diagnosis were delineated on pretreatment scans with GLCM energy extracted using imaging biomarker explorer (IBEX) software. Iterative stepwise elimination feature selection based on the Akaike information criterion identified the optimal model comprising CPFs for predicting OS in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. GLCM energy was tested for improving prediction accuracy. Results Energy was a significant predictor of OS (P\,=\,0.028) in addition to the selected CPFs. The c-indexes for the CPF-only and CPF\,+\,Energy models were 0.720 and 0.739. Conclusions Incorporating Energy strengthened a CPF model for predicting OS. These findings support further exploration of QIFs, including markers of the primary tumor vs. those of the metastatic sites.},

The selector model is trained to optimize the fidelity of the interpretations, as evaluated by a predictor model for the target. Popular methods learn the selector and predictor model in concert, which we show allows predictions to be encoded within interpretations. We introduce EVAL-X as a method to quantitatively evaluate interpretations and REAL-X as an amortized explanation method, which learn a predictor model that approximates the true data generating distribution given any subset of the input. We show EVAL-X can detect when predictions are encoded in interpretations and show the advantages of REAL-X through quantitative and radiologist evaluation.},

To address this issue, questionnaires, such as the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Risk test, have been recommended for use by physicians and the public. Based on evidence that blood glucose concentration can affect cardiac electrophysiology, we hypothesized that an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) could identify adults with new-onset diabetes. We trained a neural network to estimate HbA1c using a 12-lead ECG and readily available demographics. We retrospectively assembled a dataset comprised of patients with paired ECG and HbA1c data. The population of patients who receive both an ECG and HbA1c may a biased sample of the complete outpatient population, so we adjusted the importance placed on each patient to generate a more representative pseudo-population. We found ECG-based assessment outperforms the ADA Risk test, achieving a higher area under the curve (0.80 vs. 0.68) and positive predictive value (14\% vs. 9\%) -- 2.6 times the prevalence of diabetes in the cohort. The AI-enhanced ECG significantly outperforms electrophysiologist interpretation of the ECG, suggesting that the task is beyond current clinical capabilities. Given the prevalence of ECGs in clinics and via wearable devices, such a tool would make precise, automated diabetes assessment widely accessible.},

Background:~           Current staging methods do not accurately predict the risk of disease relapse for patients with gastric cancer.           Methods:~           We proposed a novel deep neural network (S-net) to construct a CT signature for predicting disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival in a training cohort of 457 patients, and independently tested it in an external validation cohort of 1158 patients. An integrated nomogram was constructed to demonstrate the added value of the imaging signature to established clinicopathologic factors for individualized survival prediction. Prediction performance was assessed with respect to discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.           Results:~           The DeLIS was associated with DFS and overall survival in the overall validation cohort and among subgroups defined by clinicopathologic variables, and remained an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis (P{$<$} 0.001). Integrating the imaging signature and clinicopathologic factors improved prediction performance, with C-indices: 0.792–0.802 versus 0.719–0.724, and net reclassification improvement 10.1\%–28.3\%. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved DFS in stage II patients with high-DeLIS [hazard ratio = 0.362 (95\% confidence interval 0.149–0.882)] and stage III patients with high- and intermediate-DeLIS [hazard ratio = 0.611 (0.442–0.843); 0.633 (0.433–0.925)]. On the other hand, adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect survival for patients with low-DeLIS, suggesting a predictive effect (Pinteraction = 0.048, 0.016 for DFS in stage II and III disease).           Conclusions:~           The proposed imaging signature improved prognostic prediction and could help identify patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the promising results of immunotherapy in cancer treatment, new response patterns, including pseudoprogression and hyperprogression, have been observed. Radiomics is the automated extraction of high-fidelity, high-dimensional imaging features from standard medical images, allowing comprehensive visualization and characterization of the tissue of interest and corresponding microenvironment. This study assessed whether radiomics can predict response to immunotherapy in patients with malignant tumors of the digestive system. Material/Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of patients with malignant tumors of the digestive system obtained at baseline and after immunotherapy were subjected to radiomics analyses. Radiomics features were extracted from each image. The formula of the screened features and the final predictive model were obtained using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm. Results Imaging analysis was feasible in 87 patients, including 3 with pseudoprogression and 7 with hyperprogression. One hundred ten radiomics features were obtained before and after treatment, including 109 features of the target lesions and 1 of the aorta. Four models were constructed, with the model constructed from baseline and post-treatment CT features having the best classification performance, with a sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 83.3\%, 88.9\%, and 0.806, respectively. Conclusions Radiomics can predict the response of patients with malignant tumors of the digestive system to immunotherapy and can supplement conventional evaluations of response.},

  doi = {doi:10.1001/jama.294.2.218.},
  abstract = {Context Controversy and uncertainty ensue when the results of clinical research on the effectiveness of interventions are subsequently contradicted. Controversies are most prominent when high-impact research is involved. Objectives To understand how frequently highly cited studies are contradicted or find effects that are stronger than in other similar studies and to discern whether specific characteristics are associated with such refutation over time. Design All original clinical research studies published in 3 major general clinical journals or high-impact-factor specialty journals in 1990-2003 and cited more than 1000 times in the literature were examined. Main Outcome Measure The results of highly cited articles were compared against subsequent studies of comparable or larger sample size and similar or better controlled designs. The same analysis was also performed comparatively for matched studies that were not so highly cited. Results Of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45 claimed that the intervention was effective. Of these, 7 (16\%) were contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 others (16\%) had found effects that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44\%) were replicated, and 11 (24\%) remained largely unchallenged. Five of 6 highly-cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found stronger effects vs 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (P = .008). Among randomized trials, studies with contradicted or stronger effects were smaller (P = .009) than replicated or unchallenged studies although there was no statistically significant difference in their early or overall citation impact. Matched control studies did not have a significantly different share of refuted results than highly cited studies, but they included more studies with “negative” results. Conclusions Contradiction and initially stronger effects are not unusual in highly cited research of clinical interventions and their outcomes. The extent to which high citations may provoke contradictions and vice versa needs more study. Controversies are most common with highly cited nonrandomized studies, but even the most highly cited randomized trials may be challenged and refuted over time, especially small ones.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This review highlights the physiological mechanisms underlying the neural regulation of the kidney, normally to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis, and in pathophysiological states of hypertension and renal disease. It is relevant because of the demonstration that bilateral renal denervation in different hypertensive groups causes a sustained reduction in blood pressure., Recent findings: There are patients groups in whom their hypertension is resistant to antihypertensive drugs or with renal diseases in which they are contraindicated. Recently, medical devices have been developed to manipulate the sympathetic nervous system, for example, implantation of carotid sinus nerve stimulating electrodes and ablation of the renal innervation. These approaches have been relatively successful but there remains a lack of understanding of the neural mechanisms impinging on the kidney that regulate long-term control of blood pressure., Summary: The observation that bilateral renal nerve ablation can reduce blood pressure represents an important therapeutic milestone. Nonetheless, questions arise as to the underlying mechanisms, the long-term consequences, whether there may be re-innervation over a number of years, or whether some unknown consequence to the denervation may arise. This may point to the development of novel compounds targeted to the innervation of the kidney., (C) 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins},

This elision of concepts is misleading and incorrect. First, the promise that AI will reduce human workload rests on a too narrow assessment of what constitutes workload in the first place. Human operators need new skills and deal with new responsibilities, these systems need an elaborate infrastructure and support system that all contribute to an increased amount of human work and short-term efficiency wins may become sources of long-term inefficiency. Second, for the realization of increased efficiency, the human-side of technology implementation is determinate. Human knowledge, competencies and trust can foster or undermine efficiency. We conclude that is important to remain conscious and critical about how we talk about expected benefits of AI, especially when referring to systemic changes based on single studies.},

  abstract = {Identifying predictive factors for an outcome of interest via a multivariable analysis is often difficult when the data set is small. Combining data from different medical centers into a single (larger) database would alleviate this problem, but is in practice challenging due to regulatory and logistic problems. Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that aims to construct from local inferences in separate data centers what would have been inferred had the data sets been merged. It seeks to harvest the statistical power of larger data sets without actually creating them. The FL strategy is not always efficient and precise. Therefore, in this paper we refine and implement an alternative Bayesian federated inference (BFI) framework for multicenter data with the same aim as FL. The BFI framework is designed to cope with small data sets by inferring locally not only the optimal parameter values, but also additional features of the posterior parameter distribution, capturing information beyond what is used in FL. BFI has the additional benefit that a single inference cycle across the centers is sufficient, whereas FL needs multiple cycles. We quantify the performance of the proposed methodology on simulated and real life data.},

Pooling data from different data sets collected in different (medical) centers would alleviate this problem, but is often not feasible due to privacy regulation or logistic problems. An alternative route would be to analyze the local data in the centers separately and combine the statistical inference results with the Bayesian Federated Inference (BFI) methodology. The aim of this approach is to compute from the inference results in separate centers what would have been found if the statistical analysis was performed on the combined data. We explain the methodology under homogeneity and heterogeneity across the populations in the separate centers, and give real life examples for better understanding. Excellent performance of the proposed methodology is shown. An R-package to do all the calculations has been developed and is illustrated in this paper.

Remuneration for these treatments is guaranteed in many countries even though basic information is missing. We draw attention to deficiencies in the database. For catheter-based renal denervation, few large-animal data are available to investigate the effect of the intervention on the histology of the arterial wall. No functional data are available regarding re-innervation. For carotid sinus stimulation, the situation is similar. Acute activation of either treatment seems to reduce sympathetic tone dramatically. However, whether or not the effects are sustained over time is unknown. No 'end-point' data are available for either treatment. Devices should be subjected to evidence-based standards before widespread introduction.}

However, good performance on these metrics may not translate to improved clinical outcomes. Instead, we argue for a better development pipeline constructed by working backward from the end goal of positively impacting clinically relevant outcomes using AI, leading to considerations of causality in model development and validation, and subsequently a better development pipeline. Healthcare AI should be “actionable,” and the change in actions induced by AI should improve outcomes. Quantifying the effect of changes in actions on outcomes is causal inference. The development, evaluation, and validation of healthcare AI should therefore account for the causal effect of intervening with the AI on clinically relevant outcomes. Using a causal lens, we make recommendations for key stakeholders at various stages of the healthcare AI pipeline. Our recommendations aim to increase the positive impact of AI on clinical outcomes.}

  abstract = {Objective: Uncontrolled hypertension under antihypertensive multidrug regimen is not necessarily always true resistance. Incomplete adherence is one of several possible causes of uncontrolled hypertension. Nonadherence remains largely unrecognized and is falsely interpreted as treatment resistance, as it is difficult to confirm or exclude objectively. This is the first study assessing adherence in patients with apparent resistant hypertension systematically via toxicological urine screening., Methods: All patients referred from primary care physicians because of uncontrolled hypertension between 2004 and 2011 were analysed. Adherence was assessed in all patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the concurrent use of at least four antihypertensive agents by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for antihypertensive drugs or their corresponding metabolites in urine., Results: A total of 375 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were referred. After optimization of drug therapy and exclusion of white coat hypertension, 108 patients met criteria for resistant hypertension. Of those, 15 patients had secondary causes of hypertension and 17 achieved goal blood pressure with quadruple antihypertensive therapy. Of the remaining 76 patients, 40 patients (53\%) were found to be nonadherent. Among nonadherent patients, 30\% had complete and 70\% had incomplete adherence; 85\% of the latter had taken less than 50\% of drugs prescribed. Lack of adherence was almost evenly distributed between different classes of antihypertensive drugs., Conclusion: Low adherence was the most common cause of poor blood pressure control in patients with apparent resistant hypertension, being twice as frequent as secondary causes of hypertension. Incomplete adherence was far more common than complete nonadherence; thus, assessment of adherence in patients on multiple drug regime is only reliable when all drugs are included in assessment. Assessing adherence by toxicological urine screening is a useful tool in detecting low adherence, especially in the setting of multidrug regimen as a cause of apparently resistant hypertension., (C) 2013 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  abstract = {The sympathetic nervous system has a profound effect on the kidney's ability to regulate blood pressure and, vice versa, the kidney has an important effect on the overall sympathetic tone. As a result, renal sympathetic nerves are crucial for initiation and the maintenance of systemic hypertension. It is fairly well established that efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity contributes significantly to homeostatic regulation of renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, renal tubular epithelial cell solute and water transport, and hormonal release. The afferent nerves from the kidney activate central sympathetic nervous system activity, participate in a reflex control system via reno-renal reflexes and are involved in cardiovascular regulation and pathogenesis of hypertension in CKD patients whose kidney ischemia also seems to play a key role. Sympathetic nerve modulation in hypertension had been considered as a therapeutic strategy long before the advent of modern pharmacological therapies. Renal sympathetic denervation with a percutaneous, catheter-based approach results in significant and sustained blood pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension. This procedure has also beneficial effects in multiple organs function. However, renal physiology and the long term observed benefits with the use of renal sympathetic denervation have not completely elucidated.}

METHODS:  Between November 2006 and December 2012, 152 consecutive patients with inoperable  stage III NSCLC who underwent definitive radiotherapy were reviewed retrospectively.  Forty-one patients were excluded for not satisfying the inclusion criteria.  Forty-five (40.5~\%) and 48 (43.2~\%) patients were diagnosed with squamous cell  carcinoma (SQC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC), respectively. The tumor reduction rate  (TRR) was defined as follows: TRR~=~1-[gross tumor volume (GTV) on computed  tomography at shrinking irradiation field planning]/(GTV on computed tomography at  the initial treatment planning). The Cox proportional hazard model was used to  identify significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and  progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: We evaluated 111 patients, with a median  follow-up time of 52.2~months in surviving patients. The median TRR was 45.9~\%. In  all patients, there were significant associations between TRR and PFS (P~=~0.036) on  multivariate analysis, although TRR had no correlation with OS (P~=~0.141). With  respect to histological subtype, multivariate analyses revealed that a higher TRR  showed significant associations with better OS and PFS in the SQC group (P~=~0.013  and 0.040, respectively). In contrast, a higher TRR was associated with poorer OS in  the ADC group (P~=~0.030); there was no association between TRR and PFS. CONCLUSION:  We found that a higher TRR is a promising prognostic factor for better survival and  disease control in SQC patients.},

  abstract = {Background Clinical practice guidelines have traditionally recommended blood pressure treatment based primarily on blood pressure thresholds. In contrast, using predicted cardiovascular risk has been advocated as a more effective strategy to guide treatment decisions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. We aimed to compare outcomes from a blood pressure-lowering treatment strategy based on predicted cardiovascular risk with one based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) level. Methods and findings We used individual participant data from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration (BPLTTC) from 1995 to 2013. Trials randomly assigned participants to either blood pressure-lowering drugs versus placebo or more intensive versus less intensive blood pressure-lowering regimens. We estimated 5-y risk of CVD events using a multivariable Weibull model previously developed in this dataset. We compared the two strategies at specific SBP thresholds and across the spectrum of risk and blood pressure levels studied in BPLTTC trials. The primary outcome was number of CVD events avoided per persons treated. We included data from 11 trials (47,872 participants). During a median of 4.0 y of follow-up, 3,566 participants (7.5\%) experienced a major cardiovascular event. Areas under the curve comparing the two treatment strategies throughout the range of possible thresholds for CVD risk and SBP demonstrated that, on average, a greater number of CVD events would be avoided for a given number of persons treated with the CVD risk strategy compared with the SBP strategy (area under the curve 0.71 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–0.72] for the CVD risk strategy versus 0.54 [95\% CI 0.53–0.55] for the SBP strategy). Compared with treating everyone with SBP ≥ 150 mmHg, a CVD risk strategy would require treatment of 29\% (95\% CI 26\%–31\%) fewer persons to prevent the same number of events or would prevent 16\% (95\% CI 14\%–18\%) more events for the same number of persons treated. Compared with treating everyone with SBP ≥ 140 mmHg, a CVD risk strategy would require treatment of 3.8\% (95\% CI 12.5\% fewer to 7.2\% more) fewer persons to prevent the same number of events or would prevent 3.1\% (95\% CI 1.5\%–5.0\%) more events for the same number of persons treated, although the former estimate was not statistically significant. In subgroup analyses, the CVD risk strategy did not appear to be more beneficial than the SBP strategy in patients with diabetes mellitus or established CVD. Conclusions A blood pressure-lowering treatment strategy based on predicted cardiovascular risk is more effective than one based on blood pressure levels alone across a range of thresholds. These results support using cardiovascular risk assessment to guide blood pressure treatment decision-making in moderate- to high-risk individuals, particularly for primary prevention.},

  abstract = {Renal sympathetic efferent and afferent nerves, which lie within and immediately adjacent to the wall of the renal arteries, contribute to the maintenance of hypertension. Because the causative factors of hypertension change over time, denervation of both efferent and afferent renal nerves should result in long-term attenuation of hypertension. The importance of the renal nerves in hypertensive patients can now be defined with the novel development of percutaneous, minimally invasive renal denervation from within the renal artery using radiofrequency energy as a therapeutic strategy. Studies thus far show that catheter-based renal denervation in patients with resistant essential hypertension lowers systolic blood pressure 27 mm Hg by 12 months, with the estimated glomerular filtration rate remaining stable. The decrease in arterial pressure after renal denervation is associated with decreased peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity, suggesting that the kidney is a source of significant central sympathetic outflow via afferent renal nerve activity.},

  abstract = {Increased sympathetic nervous system activity has been demonstrated in established one-kidney one clip hypertension in the rat. To determine the importance of the renal nerves in this model of hypertension, renal denervation or sham operation was carried out 2 weeks after clipping. Systolic blood pressure (BP) after clipping the renal artery in 27 uninephrectomized male Charles River rats increased significantly from 125 +/- 3 mm Hg to a stable level of 185 +/-7 mm Hg by 2 weeks, in association with a positive sodium balance. Renal denervation in 13 animals resulted in a significant decrease in BP to 137 +/- 7 mm Hg, while no change in BP was seen after sham operation in 14 animals. There was no difference in mean daily water intake, mean daily sodium intake, mean daily urine volume, or mean fractional urinary sodium excretion between sham-operation and renal-denervated animals during the 2 weeks after operation. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and creatinine clearance were not significantly different at sacrifice 2 weeks after operation. Six of the renal-denervated rats were followed for 11 weeks after surgery. The BP rose again to hypertensive levels (187 +/- 8 mm Hg) by 5 weeks after renal denervation. Repeat renal denervation resulted in a significant decrease to 142 +/- 8 mm Hg. Renal denervation in eight rats with established one-kidney Grollman hypertension (185 +/- 8 mm Hg) also resulted ina significant decrease in systolic BP (143 +/- 8 mm Hg). The data demonstrate the importance of intact renal nerves in the maintenance of hypertension in the one-kidney renal hypertensive rat. The depressor effect of renal denervation is not mediated by alterations in sodium intake or excretion, water intake or excretion, creatinine clearance or PRA.},

We retrospectively explored data of patients  with stage III NSCLC who underwent definitive CCRT (≥\,60~Gy) between January 2004  and March 2018 at our hospital. We examined the relationship of overall survival  (OS) with body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle index (SMI), psoas muscle index  (PMI), visceral adipose tissue index (VAI), subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SAI),  and visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (VSR) using log-rank tests  for the univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazard models for the multivariate  analysis. Overall, 16, 32, and 12 patients had stage IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC NSCLC,  respectively. The total radiotherapy dose ranged from 60~Gy/30 fractions to 66~Gy/33  fractions. In the univariate analysis, the performance status (PS), BMI, and SMI  were associated with OS, whereas the PMI, VAI, SAI, and VSR were not. In the  multivariate analysis, the PS and SMI were associated with OS. The hazard ratios and  95\% confidence intervals were 2.91 and 1.28-6.64 for PS, and 2.36 and 1.15-4.85 for  SMI, respectively. The 1, 3, and 5-year OS rates were 92.1\%, 59.6\%, and 51.0\% in  patients with high SMI, and 63.6\%, 53.8\%, and 17.9\% in patients with low SMI,  respectively. The SMI correlated with prognosis in our study population, whereas  adipose mass did not. Therefore, sarcopenia should be considered while predicting  the OS in such patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The association between sarcopenia and prognosis in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing trimodality therapy,  consisting of preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy and surgery, has not been  reported. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of sarcopenia and fat  mass with prognosis after trimodality therapy. METHODS: To assess sarcopenia, the  psoas muscle mass was measured. Using computed tomography data, including third  lumbar vertebra level images, psoas muscle mass and visceral and subcutaneous fat  mass were measured. Additionally, body mass indices, and visceral/subcutaneous fat  ratio, obtained by dividing the visceral fat index by the subcutaneous fat index,  were calculated. We investigated the relationship between these parameters and  overall survival. RESULTS: Ninety-nine eligible patients were included. In the  univariate analysis, age, clinical stage, tumor location, psoas muscle index, and  visceral/subcutaneous fat ratio were significant prognostic factors for overall  survival (P\,=\,0.008, P\,=\,0.04, P\,=\,0.04, P\,=\,0.02, and P\,=\,0.02, respectively). In  the multivariate analysis, age and psoas muscle index were significant prognostic  factors for overall survival (P\,=\,0.01 and P\,=\,0.03, respectively). The 5-year  overall survival rates for the high and low psoas muscle index groups were 79.6\%  [95\% confidence interval (CI), 67.1-94.5\%] and 66.2\% (95\% CI, 54.1-81.1\%),  respectively; whereas, the 10-year overall survival rates were 61.9\% (95\% CI,  42.0-91.4\%) and 25.3\% (95\% CI, 8.6-74.2\%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia was  related to poor overall survival in patients with locally advanced NSCLC undergoing  trimodality therapy. Assessment of body composition prior to treatment may provide  important information for formulating rational therapeutic strategies.},

Recent reports indicated that baseline tumor size (BTS) relates to the efficacy of ICI therapy for melanoma, but no study exists for NSCLC. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of BTS for ICI therapy. Patients and Methods: Data from 58 patients diagnosed with NSCLC who underwent ICI monotherapy, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to BTS (below 101 mm, above 101 mm). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: PFS of patients with a large BTS was significantly shorter than that of those with a small BTS (median; 2.07 [95\% confidence interval [CI]=0.99-6.77] months versus 6.39 [95\%CI=4.17-11.50] months) (p=0.044). OS of patients with large BTS was also significantly shorter (p{$<$}0.01). Conclusion: BTS is a predictive and prognostic negative factor of ICI therapy for NSCLC.},

  abstract = {The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has increasingly recognized the need for more personalized probabilistic predictions than those delivered by ordinal staging systems, particularly through the use of accurate risk models or calculators. However, judging the quality and acceptability of a risk model is complex. The AJCC Precision Medicine Core conducted a 2-day meeting to discuss characteristics necessary for a quality risk model in cancer patients. More specifically, the committee established inclusion and exclusion criteria necessary for a risk model to potentially be endorsed by the AJCC. This committee reviewed and discussed relevant literature before creating a checklist unique to this need of AJCC risk model endorsement. The committee identified 13 inclusion and 3 exclusion criteria for AJCC risk model endorsement in cancer. The emphasis centered on performance metrics, implementation clarity, and clinical relevance. The facilitation of personalized probabilistic predictions for cancer patients holds tremendous promise, and these criteria will hopefully greatly accelerate this process. Moreover, these criteria might be useful for a general audience when trying to judge the potential applicability of a published risk model in any clinical domain.

We performed a retrospective analysis of 920 patients treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy between 1992 and 2000. The clinical parameters included clinical stage, biopsy Gleason sum, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, and administration of external beam radiation. Patients who received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy were excluded. Failure was defined as any post-treatment administration of androgen deprivation, clinical relapse, or biochemical failure, defined as three PSA rises. Patients with fewer than three PSA rises were censored at the time of the first PSA rise. Data from two outside institutions served as validation. Results. A nomogram that predicts the probability of remaining free from biochemical recurrence for 5 years after brachytherapy without adjuvant hormonal therapy was developed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. External validation revealed a concordance index of 0.61 to 0.64, and calibration of the nomogram suggested confidence limits of +5\% to −30\%. Conclusions. The pretreatment nomogram we developed may be useful to physicians and patients in estimating the probability of successful treatment 5 years after brachytherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deep learning models may combat widening racial disparities in heart failure outcomes through early identification of individuals at high risk. However, demographic biases in the performance of these models have not been well-studied. METHODS: This retrospective analysis used 12-lead ECGs taken between 2008 and 2018 from 326\>518 patient encounters referred for standard clinical indications to Stanford Hospital. The primary model was a convolutional neural network model trained to predict incident heart failure within 5 years. Biases were evaluated on the testing set (160\>312 ECGs) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, stratified across the protected attributes of race, ethnicity, age, and sex. RESULTS: There were 59 817 cases of incident heart failure observed within 5 years of ECG collection. The performance of the primary model declined with age. There were no significant differences observed between racial groups overall. However, the primary model performed significantly worse in Black patients aged 0 to 40 years compared with all other racial groups in this age group, with differences most pronounced among young Black women. Disparities in model performance did not improve with the integration of race, ethnicity, sex, and age into model architecture, by training separate models for each racial group, or by providing the model with a data set of equal racial representation. Using probability thresholds individualized for race, age, and sex offered substantial improvements in F1 scores. CONCLUSIONS: The biases found in this study warrant caution against perpetuating disparities through the development of machine learning tools for the prognosis and management of heart failure. Customizing the application of these models by using probability thresholds individualized by race, ethnicity, age, and sex may offer an avenue to mitigate existing algorithmic disparities.},

Clinical data collected from medical records included metastatic sites at the time of pembrolizumab treatment. Treatment outcomes of pembrolizumab were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. In total, 213 patients were included in the study. The median age was 71~years (range 39–91~years). Of the 213 patients, 176 (83\%) were men and 172 (81\%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) score of 0–1. The most common metastases were thoracic lymph node metastasis (77\%), intrapulmonary metastasis (31\%), bone metastasis (28\%), and malignant pleural effusion (26\%). On multivariate analysis, a poor ECOG-PS score (hazard ratio: 1.95, 95.0\% confidence interval: 1.25–3.04; P\,=\,0.003) and malignant pleural effusion (hazard ratio: 1.52, 95.0\% confidence interval: 1.01–2.29; P\,=\,0.043) were independent predictors of shorter progression-free survival in patients treated with pembrolizumab. For NSCLC patients with malignant pleural effusion, pembrolizumab monotherapy is not a suitable first-line treatment because of its insufficient effectiveness, even though their PD-L1 TPS was high.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is among the most prevalent and serious cancer-related symptom, and is strongly correlated with a poor prognosis. Moreover, it reportedly  predicts poor prognosis after surgery in patients with lung cancer. However, it is  unclear whether sarcopenia directly affects post-operative recurrence. The purpose  of this study was to evaluate whether sarcopenia can be a risk indicator for  post-operative recurrence, and whether it suppresses anti-tumor immunity, in a  cohort of patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: This study  retrospectively reviewed the data of 256 consecutive patients who underwent curative  lobectomy and lymph node dissection for non-small cell lung cancer at our  institution. The psoas muscle mass index was calculated as the total psoas muscle  area at the third lumbar vertebral level/height2 (cm2/m2). Sarcopenia was defined by  a psoas muscle mass index of under 5.03 cm2/m2 and 3.17 cm2/m2 in male and female  patients, respectively. Post-operative prognosis and cumulative incidence of  recurrence rates were calculated. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival and  disease-free survival rates post-surgery were 59.5\% and 38.6\%, respectively, in  patients with sarcopenia versus 81.1\% and 72.1\%, respectively, in patients without  sarcopenia (p {$<$} 0.001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence rate in  patients with sarcopenia was significantly higher than those without sarcopenia  (49.9\% versus 22.4\%, respectively) in every pathological stage. Pathological stages  II and III (hazard ratio, 3.36; p = 0.004), histological type (hazard ratio, 2.31; p  = 0.025), and sarcopenia (hazard ratio, 2.52; p = 0.001) were independent risk  factors for post-operative recurrence according to multivariate analysis.  CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is a risk indicator for post-operative recurrence in patients  with non-small cell lung cancer.},

The purpose of this study is to propose a definition of sarcopenia in elderly  patients with lung cancer, and to demonstrate the post operative outcomes. METHODS:  Using computed tomography scans, the cross-sectional area (cm(2)) of the psoas  muscle at the third lumbar vertebral level was measured. The psoas area was  normalized for height. The psoas muscle mass index was calculated as total psoas  muscle area at L3 level/height(2) (cm(2)/m(2)). RESULTS: A total of 173 patients  aged\,{$>$}\,75~years of age received lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer in our  hospital. We defined sarcopenia as the psoas muscle mass index under 3.70~cm(2)/m(2)  in males and 2.50~cm(2)/m(2) in females, based on the morbidity rate. The  postoperative complication rate was significantly higher in patients with sarcopenia  (62.5\%) than in those without sarcopenia (22.7\%). The 5-year survival rate was 26.5\%  in patients with sarcopenia, and 66.3\% in patients without sarcopenia.

  abstract = {Background We previously reported metrics of systemic therapy randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in breast cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) published 1975–2004. To evaluate trends in the era of targeted therapies (TT), we have repeated a similar analysis of RCTs published 2005–2009. Methods A search for phase III RCTs of systemic agents published in five major journals 2005–2009 was carried out. Trials were classified as TT if they involved any non-hormonal targeted agent. We extracted data regarding biomarker use. Integral biomarkers were defined as tests used to determine eligibility, stratification, or allocation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze trends over time. Results One hundred and thirty-seven eligible RCTs were evaluated. Compared with 1995–2004, the number (17–27 RCTs/year) and size (median sample size 446–722, P {$<$} 0.001) of RCTs increased. The proportion of RCTs evaluating TT increased from 4\% (7/167) to 29\% (40/137) (P {$<$} 0.001). There was an increase in the proportion of trials with financial support from industry [57\% (95/167) to 78\% (107/137), P = 0.001]. Biomarkers were included in 58\% (80/137) of RCTs; integral biomarkers were included in 36\% (49/137) of trials. Among the 49 RCTs using integral biomarkers, 40 (82\%) used HER2 and/or ER/PR status in studies of breast cancer. Conclusions RCTs published in 2005–2009 are larger, more likely to evaluate TT, and be supported by industry. Biomarkers may be increasingly used, but the most common use relates to traditional use of ER/PR and evolving use of HER2 in breast cancer RCTs.},

The results showed that in control rats, hemorrhagic SBP reduction to 90 mm Hg had no effect on autoregulation of RBF (autoregulatory index = 0.09 +/- 0.02), creatinine clearance, or renal histology. However, in one week NE-ARF rats with intact renal nerves, hemorrhagic reduction in SBP to 90 mm Hg was associated with marked impairment of autoregulation of RBF (autoregulatory index = 3.49 +/- 0.25), further reduction in creatinine clearance from 0.59 +/- 0.08 ml/min to 0.36 +/- 0.14 ml/min, and histologic evidence of recurrent ischemic injury. Renal denervation prior to SBP reduction improved autoregulation of RBF (autoregulatory index = 0.30 +/- 0.09), prevented the further reduction in creatinine clearance, and significantly ameliorated the deleterious effect on renal histology seen in innervated NE-ARF rats. These results suggest the potential importance of the loss of autoregulation of RBF on the course of NE-ARF, and further support the pathogenetic role of renal nerves in the loss of autoregulation.}

  abstract = {There is growing awareness that the results of randomized clinical trials might not apply in a straightforward way to individual patients, even those within the trial. Although randomization theoretically ensures the comparability of treatment groups overall, there remain important differences between individuals in each treatment group that can dramatically affect the likelihood of benefiting from or being harmed by a therapy. Averaging effects across such different patients can give misleading results to physicians who care for individual, not average, patients.The limitations of subgroup analyses—the conventional means for exploring differences in treatment effect based on patient characteristics—are well-appreciated. Because patients in trials, as in clinical practice, have many attributes that can affect the likelihood of treatment being beneficial or harmful, exploring each of these attributes “one variable at a time” (eg, male vs female, old vs young) risks spurious false-positive subgroup results from chance fluctuations. Furthermore, although patients have simultaneous multiple characteristics that can affect the likelihood of the outcome and the effect of therapy, one-variable-at-a-time comparisons are fundamentally limited because they compare groups that vary only on a single factor, usually resulting in the subgroups being more similar than different.}

  abstract = {The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of “reference class forecasting”: implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of “similar” patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to “predictive” heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on “risk modeling” (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on “effect modeling” (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Aging is an important risk factor for disease, leading to morphological change that can be assessed on Computed Tomography (CT) scans. We propose a deep learning model for automated age estimation based on CT- scans of the thorax and abdomen generated in a clinical routine setting. These predictions could serve as imaging biomarkers to estimate a “biological” age, that better reflects a patient’s true physical condition. A pre-trained ResNet-18 model was modified to predict chronological age as well as to quantify its aleatoric uncertainty. The model was trained using 1653 non-pathological CT-scans of the thorax and abdomen of subjects aged between 20 and 85 years in a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. Generalization performance as well as robustness and reliability was assessed on a publicly available test dataset consisting of thorax-abdomen CT-scans of 421 subjects. Score-CAM saliency maps were generated for interpretation of model outputs. We achieved a mean absolute error of 5.76 ± 5.17 years with a mean uncertainty of 5.01 ± 1.44 years after 5-fold cross-validation. A mean absolute error of 6.50 ± 5.17 years with a mean uncertainty of 6.39 ± 1.46 years was obtained on the test dataset. CT-based age estimation accuracy was largely uniform across all age groups and between male and female subjects. The generated saliency maps highlighted especially the lumbar spine and abdominal aorta. This study demonstrates, that accurate and generalizable deep learning-based automated age estimation is feasible using clinical CT image data. The trained model proved to be robust and reliable. Methods of uncertainty estimation and saliency analysis improved the interpretability.},

Our result requires a factorized prior distribution over the latent variables that is conditioned on an additionally observed variable, such as a class label or almost any other observation. We build on recent developments in nonlinear ICA, which we extend to the case with noisy or undercomplete observations, integrated in a maximum likelihood framework.

We address this issue by showing that for a broad family of deep latent-variable models, identification of the true joint distribution over observed and latent variables is actually possible up to  very simple transformations, thus achieving a principled and powerful form of disentanglement. Our result requires a factorized prior distribution over the latent variables that is conditioned on an additionally observed variable, such as a class label or almost any other observation. We build on recent developments in nonlinear ICA, which we extend to the case with noisy, undercomplete or discrete observations, integrated in a maximum likelihood framework. The result also trivially contains identifiable flow-based generative models as a special case.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Prognostic models for cancer patients may improve decision making to personalize management of cancer patients. In the current study, we propose a deep learning-based predictive model for Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer patients. We developed a combined 2D and 3D model to include all 3D tumour information in CT images without losing spatial information. Method: In the current study, we enrolled 363 histopathological proven Patients from 5 different centres gathered from TCIA. In current study we aimed to predict 2 year overall survival, for this purpose continues value of survival times (calculated from start of the treatment) were dichotomized by 2-year cut-off point. We excluded right-censored patients (alive patients with follow up less than 2 years). We extracted each tumour separately based on bounding box We applied largest bounding box on each tumour separately considering the centre of mass of each lesion. Finally, we extracted a tumour region with size of 128×128×Z which Z is different for each different patient. We implemented 2D networks to construct 3D combination CNNs network. Feature extraction was performed in each 2D slices separately using same architecture and then final layer of network were averaged to train in 3D volume of tumor. Different architecture of networks including simple Xception, VGG, ResNet, Inception, and DensNet were implemented in this approach. Data of three centre (257) were used for train/validation and two centres were hold for external test set (106 patients). The predictive power of each model was assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC - ROC), precision, recall, and accuracy. DeLong tests were performed on AUC to compare different models. Results: We set up a study to predict two year overall survival in NSCLC patients using deep neural networks. In term of accuracy, VGG had highest performance of 0.75. In term of precision and recall Xception and VGG had highest value of 0.77 and 0.83, respectively. Considering all four parameters, VGG had highest performance with precision, recall, AUC, and accuracy of 0.72, 0.83, 0.78, and 0.75, respectively . There was no statistically significant difference between different models (delong test p-value {$>$}0.05). Conclusion:. In current study we proposed end-to-end prognostic modelling in NSCLC using deep neural networks and pre-treatment CT images. Notwithstanding high variability across different datasets including geographic, ethnicity and CT scanner, image acquisition and image reconstruction, proposed models performed very well on different centres.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While recent evidence has suggested that sarcopenia could predict chemotoxicity, its association with chemotherapy-triggered interstitial lung disease  (ILD) exacerbations has yet to be investigated. Thus, the present study sought to  determine whether sarcopenia could predict ILD exacerbations and overall survival  (OS) in patients with ILD-complicated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS:  From January 2010 to July 2020, 74 patients with ILD-complicated NSCLC who received  chemotherapy were retrospectively investigated. After categorizing patients  according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia based on the psoas muscle index,  ILD exacerbation rates and OS were evaluated. RESULTS: Among the patients in the  study, 39 were included in the sarcopenia group. Moreover, 17 (22.9\%) patients  developed ILD exacerbations, with the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups having an  exacerbation rate of 33.3\% and 11.4\%, respectively (p~=~0.025). Multivariate  analysis identified sarcopenia as an independent predictor of ILD exacerbations  (p~=~0.039). Furthermore, patients with sarcopenia demonstrated a significantly  shorter median OS compared to those without the same (9.2 vs. 13.3\,months;  p~=~0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia predicted chemotherapy-triggered ILD  exacerbation and OS in patients with ILD-complicated NSCLC, suggesting its utility  in determining treatment approaches.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: It is unclear whether adding concurrent chemotherapy (CT) to definitive radiotherapy (RT) following induction CT is a tolerable and cost effective treatment  for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged 70 years or older with  comorbidities. This study evaluated the actual clinical outcomes between concurrent  chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and RT alone following induction CT or not in patients (≥70  years) in a single institution's clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total  of 82 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC between 2004 and 2016 were  retrospectively analyzed. Their treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes such as  overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRR), treatment toxicities and  distant metastasis (DM) were evaluated. Early mortality rates were also evaluated as  4-month mortality after RT. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients received CCRT and 28  patients received RT alone. Induction CT before RT was performed for 68.5\% and 50.0\%  in CCRT and RT alone groups. Treatment tolerance was significantly worse in CCRT (p  = 0.046). The median survival was 21.1 and 18.1 months for CCRT and RT alone, which  was not statistically significant. LRR and DM were also not different. Most early  deaths after CCRT were attributed to non-cancer-related mortality. Acute esophagitis  of grade ≥2 occurred more following CCRT (p = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, a  Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of ≥5 and a weight loss of ≥5\% after RT were  associated with poor OS. The factors adversely affecting 4-month survival were a CCI  of ≥5 and CCRT. CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in OS, LRR, and DM  between CCRT and RT alone treatment in elderly patients. However, there was a poorer  tolerance and higher incidence of acute esophagitis in the CCRT group. Specifically,  when the patients had a CCI of ≥5, RT alone seems to be reasonable with a low  probability of early death.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of computed tomography–determined sarcopenia on surgical complications and outcomes after resection of non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: For a total 272 non-small cell lung cancer patients that underwent surgery between 2011 and 2016, cross-sectional area of muscle at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) was retrospectively measured using preoperative chest computed tomography images. Sarcopenia was defined as an L3 muscle index of \&lt;55 cm2/m2 for men and of \&lt;39 cm2/m2 for women. Clinical characteristics, postoperative complications, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients with or without sarcopenia were compared. Results: A total of 60.3\% (n = 164) were male, and mean patient age was 62.9 ± 9.6 years. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 22.4\% for all study subjects, 32.9\% for men, and 6.5\% for women. No significant difference was observed between patients with or without sarcopenia in terms of intensive care unit or hospital stay (p = 0.502 and p = 0.378, respectively), and the presence of sarcopenia was not associated with postoperative complications. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between the 3-year disease-free survival rate (74.3\% vs 66.7\%, p = 0.639) or 3-year overall survival rate (83.9\% vs 87.7\%, p = 0.563) of patients with or without sarcopenia. Conclusion: Sarcopenia as determined by preoperative computed tomography does not appear to have a negative impact on surgical outcome or overall survival for resected non-small cell lung cancer patients. © The Finnish Surgical Society 2017.},

  abstract = {Background: Sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer. Skeletal muscle area can be quantified based on radiodensity of CT scan. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of radiodensity-based detailed skeletal muscle quantification on outcomes after surgery of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Single cross-sectional area of the skeletal muscle (-29 to 150 HU) at the 3rd lumbar vertebra (L3) level retrospectively measured on preoperative CT for NSCLC patients (n=272), who underwent surgical resection during 2011 to 2016. The diagnosis of sarcopenia was made when a L3 muscle index (L3MI; L3 muscle area/height2) of less than 55 cm2/m2 for men and less than 39 cm2/m2 for women. Skeletal muscle was subsequently classified based on radiodensity level as low attenuation muscle (-29 to {$<$}30 HU) and high attenuation muscle (30 to 150 HU). Using a maximal-chi-squared test, low attenuation muscle accounted less than 24.5\% of the total muscle, which was considered healthy muscle. Data on clinical characteristics (demographic information, TNM stage, histology) and prognosis (disease-free survival; DFS, and overall survival; OS) were collected. Results: Sarcopenia was found 22.4\% in preoperative CT (32.9\% for men and 6.5\% for women). The prevalence of patients with healthy muscle was 15.4\% (21.3\% for men and 6.5\% for women). There was no significant difference between the 3-year DFS rate (77.0\% vs. 67.0\%, P=0.142) or 3-year OS rate (84.8\% vs. 87.9\%, P=0.576) between patients with and without sarcopenia. However, patients with healthy muscle tend to show longer 3-year DFS rate (79.4\% vs. 67.2\%, P=0.094) and 3-year OS rate (92.6\% vs. 86.1\%, P=0.176). In the multivariable analysis, healthy muscle was one of the independent prognosticators for a 3-year DFS rate (HR, 0.50, P=0.035), along with R1 resection (HR, 5.90, P{$<$}0.001), pathologic T stage (HR, 2.69, P{$<$}0.001), and pathologic N stage (HR, 2.43, P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: The proportion of low attenuation muscle was associated with DFS in resected lung cancer patients. Further investigation is needed to establish whether radiodensity-based detailed skeletal muscle quantification could be early biomarker to predict prognosis in NSCLC. © 2021 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

METHODS: A total of 130 patients with stage III NSCLC who underwent  definitive CRT were identified. We obtained PET-CT parameters such as maximum  (SUV(max)) and mean (SUV(mean)) standardized uptake value, total lesion glycolysis  (TLG), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and coefficient of variation (CV). Each  parameter was bifurcated based on the optimal cutoff, and propensity score matching  was performed between the SqCC and ADC groups. RESULTS: There were 108 patients with  SqCC or ADC, and 44 patients each were allocated to the SqCC and ADC groups via  propensity score matching. SUV(max), SUV(mean), TLG, and MTV values were  significantly higher in SqCC than in ADC (P~= .004, P~= .006, P~= .003, and P~= .03,  respectively). In the SqCC group, PET-CT parameters were not associated with  survival outcomes. However, in the ADC group, SUV(max) and SUV(mean) were related to  locoregional progression-free survival (P~= .008 and P~= .017, respectively), and  TLG and MTV were related to overall survival (P~=~.044 and P~{$<$} .001, respectively).  In addition, patients with ADC showed more frequent distant metastasis (P~=~.011)  and worse distant metastasis-free survival compared with patients with SqCC (P~=  .009). CONCLUSIONS: PET-CT provided different prognostic implications between SqCC  and ADC in patients with locally advanced NSCLC receiving radical CRT. This suggests  that it is necessary to consider the histologic subtype and PET-CT parameters  concurrently when predicting survival outcomes.},

NOS enzyme activity was measured as the rate of [3H]arginine conversion to citrulline, and the level of nNOS mRNA signal was determined using in situ hybridization and image analysis. NOS-positive cells were also visualized using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-diaphorase) histochemistry and by immunohistochemistry using an anti-nNOS antibody. A significant increase of NOS enzyme activity in the anterior pituitary, adrenal cortex, and adrenal medulla (1.5-, 3.5-, and 2.5-fold) was observed in the stressed animals (immobilization of 6 h) as compared to non-stressed control rats. Up-regulation of nNOS mRNA expression in anterior pituitary and adrenal cortex was already detectable after stress for 2 h with 1.5- and 2-fold increase, respectively. The nNOS mRNA signals in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) significantly increased after the stress for 6 h. This increase in NOS enzyme activity was confirmed using NADPH-diaphorase staining and immunostaining in the PVN and adrenal cortex. An increase of NOS enzyme activity in adrenal medulla after immobilization for 6 h posited by far longer than in the adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary. The present findings suggest that psychological and/or physiological stress causes NO release in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and in sympatho-adrenal system. It is suggested that NO may modulate a stress-induced activation of the HPA axis and the sympatho-adrenal medullary system. The different duration of stress-induced NOS activity in HPA axis and the adrenal medulla may suggest NO synthesis is controlled by separate mechanism in the two HPA and the sympatho-adrenal systems.},

  abstract = {The bootstrap provides a simple and powerful means of assessing the quality of estimators. However, in settings involving large datasets---which are increasingly prevalent---the computation of bootstrap-based quantities can be prohibitively demanding computationally. While variants such as subsampling and the \$m\$ out of \$n\$ bootstrap can be used in principle to reduce the cost of bootstrap computations, we find that these methods are generally not robust to specification of hyperparameters (such as the number of subsampled data points), and they often require use of more prior information (such as rates of convergence of estimators) than the bootstrap. As an alternative, we introduce the Bag of Little Bootstraps (BLB), a new procedure which incorporates features of both the bootstrap and subsampling to yield a robust, computationally efficient means of assessing the quality of estimators. BLB is well suited to modern parallel and distributed computing architectures and furthermore retains the generic applicability and statistical efficiency of the bootstrap. We demonstrate BLB's favorable statistical performance via a theoretical analysis elucidating the procedure's properties, as well as a simulation study comparing BLB to the bootstrap, the \$m\$ out of \$n\$ bootstrap, and subsampling. In addition, we present results from a large-scale distributed implementation of BLB demonstrating its computational superiority on massive data, a method for adaptively selecting BLB's hyperparameters, an empirical study applying BLB to several real datasets, and an extension of BLB to time series data.},

Rats were perfused with 4\% paraformaldehyde or 2\% paraformaldehyde + 0.15\% picric acid in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, then transferred to the buffer. After 24–48 hours, the kidneys were sectioned with a Vibratome at 200 or 300 μm and incubated in the primary antiserum for 18 hours at room temperature. A sparse plexus of VIPI nerves innervates the rat renal calyx. Some VIPI nerves innervate interlobar arteries and each succeeding segment of the arterial tree including afferent arterioles, but most innervate arcuate and interlobular arteries. VIPI axons do not innervate each arcuate artery or each interlobular branch of an arcuate artery with equal density. Although some axons follow each interlobular branch, most form a dense plexus on only one or two branches. Therefore, most VIPI nerves in the rat kidney innervate a restricted segment of the renal arterial tree. These nerves may be efferent and may selectively dilate arcuate and smaller arteries, or they may be afferent and may sense local changes in mechanical or chemical parameters.},

Because pregnancy has many similarities with transplantation, we hypothesize that induction of allogeneic tolerance to the paternal HLA molecules of the fetus may be crucial. Recent data suggest that exposure, and especially oral exposure to soluble HLA (sHLA) or HLA derived peptides can lead to transplantation tolerance. Similarly, sHLA antigens, that are present in the seminal plasma, might cause tolerance in the mother to paternal antigens. In order to test whether this indeed may be the case, we investigated whether sHLA antigens are present in seminal plasma. Using a specific ELISA we detected sHLA class I molecules in seminal plasma. The level varied between individuals and was related to the level in plasma. Further studies showed that these sHLA class I molecules included classical HLA class I alleles, such as sHLA-A2, -B7, -B51, -B35 and sHLA-A9. Preliminary data show lower levels of sHLA in seminal plasma in the preeclampsia group, although not significantly different from the control group. An extension of the present study is necessary to verify this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) continue to have  a poor prognosis. It is known that FDG PET/CT improves staging, treatment selection  and target volume delineation (TVD), and although its use has grown rapidly, it is  still not widely available in LMIC. CRT is often used as sequential treatment, but  is known to be more effective when given concurrently. The aim of the PERTAIN study  was to assess the impact of introducing FDG PET/CT-guided concurrent CRT, supported  by training and quality control (QC), on the overall survival (OS) and  progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with stage III NSCLC. METHODS: The study  included patients with stage III NSCLC from nine medical centres in seven countries.  A retrospective cohort was managed according to local practices between January 2010  and July 2014, which involved only optional diagnostic FDG PET/CT for staging (not  for TVD), followed by sequential or concurrent CRT. A prospective cohort between  August 2015 and October 2018 was treated according to the study protocol including  FDG PET/CT in treatment position for staging and multimodal TVD followed by  concurrent CRT by specialists trained in protocol-specific TVD and with TVD QC.  Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess OS and PFS in the retrospective and  prospective cohorts. RESULTS: Guidelines for FDG PET/CT image acquisition and TVD  were developed and published. All specialists involved in the PERTAIN study received  training between June 2014 and May 2016. The PET/CT scanners used received EARL  accreditation. In November 2018 a planned interim analysis was performed including  230 patients in the retrospective cohort with a median follow-up of 14~months and  128 patients in the prospective cohort, of whom 69 had a follow-up of at least  1~year. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, OS was significantly longer in the  prospective cohort than in the retrospective cohort (23 vs. 14~months, p\,=\,0.012).  In addition, median PFS was significantly longer in the prospective cohort than in  the retrospective cohort (17 vs. 11~months, p\,=\,0.012). CONCLUSION: In the PERTAIN  study, the preliminary results indicate that introducing FDG PET/CT-guided  concurrent CRT for patients with stage III NSCLC in LMIC resulted in a significant  improvement in OS and PFS. The final study results based on complete data are  expected in 2020.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the pathophysiologic importance of renal nerves in regulating the renal vasomotor tone, we measured several parameters of renal cortical microcirculation before and after acute renal denervation (DNx) in the following three groups of anesthetized Munich-Wistar rats: (group 1) congestive heart failure after surgically induced myocardial infarction (n = 10), (group 2) acute extracellular fluid volume depletion after deprivation of drinking water for 48 h (n = 8), and (group 3) sham or nontreated controls (n = 6). In the myocardial-infarcted rats, DNx led to a uniform increase in glomerular plasma flow rate of, on average, 36\%. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate of myocardial-infarcted rats also increased despite a reduction in glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure. These changes were associated with a fall in arteriolar resistances, particularly in the efferent arteriole. The glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient rose in all but one myocardial-infarcted animal. A similar hemodynamic pattern was seen after DNx in water-deprived animals. In every water-deprived animal, glomerular plasma flow rate and single nephron GFR increased on average by 28 and 14\%, respectively. Again, afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances decreased significantly. Furthermore, the ultrafiltration coefficient increased uniformly and substantially with DNx. To ascertain the potential importance of the interaction between the renal nerves and angiotensin II in these circumstances, we compared the renal cortical hemodynamics in additional groups of water-deprived rats (group 4) after DNx (n = 15), (group 5) during inhibition of angiotensin II with saralasin (n = 15), and (group 6) during treatment with both saralasin and DNx (n = 15). No appreciable difference was detected between group 4 vs. 6. In contrast, substantial differences were noted between group 5 vs. 6: on average, the glomerular plasma flow rate was 26\% higher and the afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances 25\% and 27\% lower, respectively, in group 6. These observations provide direct evidence to indicate pathophysiologic importance of renal nerves in the profound intrarenal circulatory adjustments in prerenal circulatory impairment. The vasoconstrictive effects of renal nerves appear to be mediated in part by their stimulatory influence on angiotensin II release and their direct constrictor actions on pre- and post-glomerular vessels as well.}

METHODS: We enrolled 191 patients with  stage III NSCLC from 2001 to 2009 undergoing definitive CCRT. The GTV of 157  patients was delineated at the planning CT prior to CCRT and with a follow-up CT 1  month after CCRT. We assessed the volumetric parameters of pre-treatment GTV  (GTVpre) post-treatment GTV (GTVpost), and volume reduction ratio of GTV (VRR). The  primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints were  progression-free survival (PFS) and locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS).  The best cut-off value was defined as that which exhibited the maximum difference  between the two groups. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 52.7 months in  surviving patients. Median survival, 3-year OS, PFS and LRPFS rates were 25.5  months, 36.4\%, 23.0\%, and 45.0\%, respectively. The selected cut-off values were 50  cm(3) for GTVpre, 20 cm(3) for GTVpost, and 50\% for VRR. The smaller GTVpre and  GTVpost values were associated with better OS (p{$<$}0.001 and p=0.015) and PFS (p=0.001  and p=0.004), respectively, upon univariate analysis. The higher VRR of\,{$>$}\,50\% was  associated with a trend toward poorer OS (p=0.004) and PFS (p=0.054). Upon  multivariate analysis, smaller GTVpre indicated significantly improved OS (p=0.001),  PFS (p=0.013) and LRPFS (p=0.002), while smaller GTVpost was marginally significant  for PFS (p=0.086). Higher VRR was associated with a trend toward poorer OS  (p=0.075). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage III NSCLC undergoing definitive CCRT,  GTVpre was an independent prognostic factor of survival. Notably, improved outcome  was not correlated with higher VRR after short-term follow-up with CT alone.},

  abstract = {The kidney is innervated with efferent sympathetic nerve fibers reaching the renal vasculature, the tubules, the juxtaglomerular granular cells, and the renal pelvic wall. The renal sensory nerves are mainly found in the renal pelvic wall. Increases in efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity reduce renal blood flow and urinary sodium excretion by activation of α1-adrenoceptors and increase renin secretion rate by activation of β1-adrenoceptors. In response to normal physiological stimulation, changes in efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity contribute importantly to homeostatic regulation of sodium and water balance. The renal mechanosensory nerves are activated by stretch of the renal pelvic tissue produced by increases in renal pelvic tissue of a magnitude that may occur during increased urine flow rate. Activation of the sensory nerves elicits an inhibitory renorenal reflex response consisting of decreases in efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity leading to natriuresis. Increasing efferent sympathetic nerve activity increases afferent renal nerve activity which, in turn, decreases efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity by activation of the renorenal reflexes. Thus, activation of the afferent renal nerves buffers changes in efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity in the overall goal of maintaining sodium balance. In pathological conditions of sodium retention, impairment of the inhibitory renorenal reflexes contributes to an inappropriately increased efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity in the presence of sodium retention. In states of renal disease or injury, there is a shift from inhibitory to excitatory reflexes originating in the kidney. Studies in essential hypertensive patients have shown that renal denervation results in long-term reduction in arterial pressure, suggesting an important role for the efferent and afferent renal nerves in hypertension.},

  abstract = {Purpose Combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may improve the local response to radiation and the systemic response to immunotherapy. However, no prognostic markers exist to identify patients likely to benefit from combined therapy. The degree of T cell–mediated immunity, which can be quantified with radiomics using computed tomography (CT) imaging, is predictive of immunotherapy response. Herein we investigated whether a validated T cell radiomics score (RS) is correlated with clinical outcomes after multisite SBRT and pembrolizumab (SBRT + P). Methods and Materials The RS was quantified for 68 patients with metastatic treatment-refractory adult solid tumors who received SBRT (30-50 Gy, 3-5 fractions) and pembrolizumab ≤7 days after SBRT. RS was calculated using 8 variables, including 5 radiomics features extracted from pretreatment CT scans. At a prespecified cutoff of the 25th percentile, we assessed the association between RS and clinical outcomes. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival outcomes. The prognostic effect of RS was assessed via logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards models. In an exploratory analysis, RS was also analyzed as a continuous variable. Results One hundred thirty-nine tumors were analyzed. At the 25th percentile cutoff, high-RS patients were more likely to exhibit irradiated tumor responses to SBRT + P (odds ratio [OR] 10.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.76-59.17; P = .012). High-RS was associated with improved TMC compared with low-RS tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 0.18; 95\% CI, 0.04-0.74; P = .018). Furthermore, high-RS patients had improved PFS (HR 0.47, 95\% CI, 0.26-0.85; P = .013) and OS (HR 0.39, 95\% CI, 0.20-0.75; P = .005). As a continuous variable, higher RS was associated with improved PFS (HR 0.12, 95\% CI, 0.03-0.51; P = .004) but did not reach statistical significance for TMC (HR 0.36, 95\% CI, 0.02-7.02; P = .502) or OS (HR 0.28, 95\% CI, 0.05-1.55; P = .144). Conclusions We demonstrated the clinical validity of RS (at the 25th percentile cutoff) as a prognostic biomarker in patients treated with SBRT + P. Future validation of the prognostic value of RS in larger similarly treated patient cohorts is warranted.},

  abstract = {The comparative study of the results of various segmentation methods for the digital images of the follicular lymphoma cancer tissue section is described in this paper. The sensitivity and specificity and some other parameters of the following adaptive threshold methods of segmentation: the Niblack method, the Sauvola method, the White method, the Bernsen method, the Yasuda method and the Palumbo method, are calculated. Methods are applied to three types of images constructed by extraction of the brown colour information from the artificial images synthesized based on counterpart experimentally captured images. This paper presents usefulness of the microscopic image synthesis method in evaluation as well as comparison of the image processing results. The results of thoughtful analysis of broad range of adaptive threshold methods applied to: (1) the blue channel of RGB, (2) the brown colour extracted by deconvolution and (3) the 'brown component' extracted from RGB allows to select some pairs: method and type of image for which this method is most efficient considering various criteria e.g. accuracy and precision in area detection or accuracy in number of objects detection and so on. The comparison shows that the White, the Bernsen and the Sauvola methods results are better than the results of the rest of the methods for all types of monochromatic images. All three methods segments the immunopositive nuclei with the mean accuracy of 0.9952, 0.9942 and 0.9944 respectively, when treated totally. However the best results are achieved for monochromatic image in which intensity shows brown colour map constructed by colour deconvolution algorithm. The specificity in the cases of the Bernsen and the White methods is 1 and sensitivities are: 0.74 for White and 0.91 for Bernsen methods while the Sauvola method achieves sensitivity value of 0.74 and the specificity value of 0.99. According to Bland-Altman plot the Sauvola method selected objects are segmented without undercutting the area for true positive objects but with extra false positive objects. The Sauvola and the Bernsen methods gives complementary results what will be exploited when the new method of virtual tissue slides segmentation be develop.}

This study performs a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of radiomics based prognostic models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods A literature review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for articles investigating radiomics features predictive of overall survival (OS) in NSCLC treated with curative intent radiotherapy. A random-effects meta-analysis of Harrell’s Concordance Index (C-index) was performed on the performance of radiomics models. Results Of the 2746 articles retrieved, 40 studies of 55 datasets and 6223 patients were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. There was significant heterogeneity in the methodology for feature selection and model development. Twelve datasets reported the C-index of radiomics based models in predicting OS and were included in the meta-analysis. The C-index random effects estimate was 0.57 (95\% CI 0.53–0.62). There was significant heterogeneity (I2~=~70.3\%). Conclusions Based on this review, radiomics based models for lung cancer have to date demonstrated modest prognostic capabilities. Future research should consider using standardised radiomics features, robust feature selection and model development, and deep learning techniques, absolving the need for pre-defined features, to improve imaging-based models.},

  abstract = {Electronic health records (EHR) are used to study treatment effects in clinical settings, yet unmeasured confounding remains a persistent challenge. Indirect measurements of the unmeasured confounder (proxies) offer a potential solution, but existing approaches -- such as proximal inference or full joint modeling -- can be difficult to implement. We propose a two-stage, proxy-based method that is practical, broadly applicable, and robust. In the first stage, we apply factor analysis to proxy and treatment variables, extracting information on latent factors that serve as a surrogate for the unmeasured confounder. In the second stage, we use this model to build covariates that improve causal effect estimation in a standard outcome regression model. Through simulations, we test the method's performance under assumption violations, including non-normal errors, model misspecification, and scenarios where instruments or confounders are incorrectly treated as proxies. We also apply the method to estimate the effect of hospital admission for older adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, a setting where standard analyses may fail to recover plausible effects. Our results show that this simplified strategy recovers more reliable estimates than conventional adjustment methods, offering applied researchers a practical tool for addressing unmeasured confounding with proxy variables.}

Fibrosis is a common consequence of tissue injury involving necrotic cell death. Using tissue specimens from experimental mouse models of traumatic brain injury, cardiac fibrosis, and cancer, as well as human tumor specimens assembled in tissue microarray (TMA) format, we undertook computer-assisted quantification of specific immunohistochemical and histological parameters that characterize processes associated with cell death. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of image analysis algorithms for color deconvolution, colocalization, and nuclear morphometry to characterize cell death events in tissue specimens: (a) subjected to immunostaining for detecting cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase, cleaved lamin-A, phosphorylated histone H2AX, and Bcl-2; (b) analyzed by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay to detect DNA fragmentation; and (c) evaluated with Masson's trichrome staining. We developed novel algorithm-based scoring methods and validated them using TMAs as a high-throughput format. The proposed computer-assisted scoring methods for digital images by brightfield microscopy permit linear quantification of immunohistochemical and histochemical stainings. Examples are provided of digital image analysis performed in automated or semiautomated fashion for successful quantification of molecular events associated with cell death in tissue sections.

  abstract = {Policymakers seeking to target health policies efficiently towards specific population groups need to know which individuals stand to benefit the most from each of these policies. While traditional approaches for subgroup analyses are constrained to only consider a small number of pre-defined subgroups, recently proposed causal machine learning (CML) approaches help explore treatment-effect heterogeneity in a more flexible yet principled way. Causal forests use a generalisation of the random forest algorithm to estimate heterogenous treatment effects both at the individual and the subgroup level. Our paper aims to explore this approach in the setting of health policy evaluation with strong observed confounding, applied specifically to the context of mothers’ health insurance enrolment in Indonesia. Comparing two health insurance schemes (subsidised and contributory) against no insurance, we find beneficial average impacts of enrolment in contributory health insurance on maternal health care utilisation and infant mortality, but no impact of subsidised health insurance. The causal forest algorithm identified significant heterogeneity in the impacts of contributory insurance, not just along socioeconomic variables that we pre-specified (indicating higher benefits for poorer, less educated, and rural women), but also according to some other characteristics not foreseen prior to the analysis, suggesting in particular important geographical impact heterogeneity. Our study demonstrates the power of CML approaches to uncover unexpected heterogeneity in policy impacts. The findings from our evaluation of past health insurance expansions can potentially guide the re-design of the eligibility criteria for subsidised health insurance in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {Domain generalization is a ubiquitous challenge for machine learning in healthcare. Model performance in real-world conditions might be lower than expected because of discrepancies between the data encountered during deployment and development. Underrepresentation of some groups or conditions during model development is a common cause of this phenomenon. This challenge is often not readily addressed by targeted data acquisition and ‘labeling’ by expert clinicians, which can be prohibitively expensive or practically impossible because of the rarity of conditions or the available clinical expertise. We hypothesize that advances in generative artificial intelligence can help mitigate this unmet need in a steerable fashion, enriching our training dataset with synthetic examples that address shortfalls of underrepresented conditions or subgroups. We show that diffusion models can automatically learn realistic augmentations from data in a label-efficient manner. We demonstrate that learned augmentations make models more robust and statistically fair in-distribution and out of distribution. To evaluate the generality of our approach, we studied three distinct medical imaging contexts of varying difficulty: (1) histopathology, (2) chest X-ray and (3) dermatology images. Complementing real samples with synthetic ones improved the robustness of models in all three medical tasks and increased fairness by improving the accuracy of clinical diagnosis within underrepresented groups, especially out of distribution.},

  abstract = {A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world physical phenomena that uses mathematical modeling to characterize and simulate its defining features. By constructing digital twins for disease processes, we can perform in-silico simulations that mimic patients' health conditions and counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical interventions in a virtual setting. This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of learning a differentiable simulator of a physiological process. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct physiological measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining. We apply our method to identify digital twins of cardiac hemodynamics using noninvasive echocardiogram videos, and demonstrate its utility in unsupervised disease detection and in-silico clinical trials.},

  abstract = {During the past few years there has been a global spread of resistant gram-negative bacteria that are insensitive to cephalosporins and carbapenems. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria are capable of inactivating the newest generation of cephalosporins. It is notable that ESBL-producing bacteria are found predominantly outside the hospital situation in the environment, in food and in meat products, which leads to the presumption that the food chain is contributing to the rapid spread of these bacteria. Several types of carbapenemase-producing bacteria have been distinguished, of which the 'New Delhi metallo beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)' type seems to be prevalent in Asia outside the hospital situation in the community, and is now being transmitted to other continents as a result of migration and tourism. With the rise of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria (which are also often resistant to most other antibiotics) comes the very real concern that treatment of infections such as urinary tract infections that are currently simple to treat with common oral antibiotics will be problematic in the future. The widespread use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is an important factor in the problem of antibiotic resistance. Since economic motives are of importance, a coordinated approach from many parties concerned will be necessary, not just from the medical sector but also from the veterinary and agricultural world, and from food producers and pharmaceutical companies to combat the spread of multiresistant gram-negative bacteria effectively.},

  abstract = {Resistant hypertension (RHTN) is an increasingly common clinical problem that is often heterogeneous in etiology, risk factors, and comorbidities. It is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure on optimal doses of three antihypertensive agents, ideally one being a diuretic. The definition also includes controlled hypertension with use of four or more antihypertensive agents. Recent observational studies have advanced the characterization of patients with RHTN. Patients with RHTN have higher rates of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with patients with more easily controlled hypertension. Secondary causes of hypertension, including obstructive sleep apnea, primary aldosteronism, renovascular disease, are common in patients with RHTN and often coexist in the same patient. In addition, RHTN is often complicated by metabolic abnormalities. Patients with RHTN require a thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and optimize treatment, which typically includes a combination of lifestyle adjustments, and pharmacologic and interventional treatment. Combination therapy including a diuretic, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist where warranted is the classic regimen for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone or eplerenone have been shown to be efficacious in patients with RHTN, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and primary aldosteronism. Novel interventional therapies, including baroreflex activation and renal denervation, have shown that both of these methods may be used to lower blood pressure safely, thereby providing exciting and promising new options to treat RHTN.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms—such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks—to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.}

Methods The survey group consisted of 993 women who presented at the primary care units in Umraniye District of Istanbul, Turkey, between 1 October 2006 and 31 March 2008, and started to use a new method. Women were enrolled until reaching a limit of 250 new users for each method, or expiration of the six-month registration period. Participants were followed for up to one year of method use. Results The characteristics of women who chose the SDM were similar to those of participants who opted for other methods. The most common reasons for selecting it were that it is natural and causes no side effects. Fifty-one percent used the SDM for the full year, compared to 71\% who chose an intrauterine device (IUD). Continuation rates were significantly lower for all other methods. During the one-year follow-up period, 12\% of SDM-, 7\% of pill-, 7\% of condom-, 3\% of monthly injection-, 1\% of quarterly injection-, and 0.5\% of IUD users became pregnant. Conclusion The SDM had relatively high continuation rates and relatively good levels of satisfaction among participants and their husbands. It should be mentioned among the routinely offered contraceptive methods.},

  abstract = {Machine learning can impact people with legal or ethical consequences when it is used to automate decisions in areas such as insurance, lending, hiring, and predictive policing.  In many of these scenarios, previous decisions have been made that are unfairly biased against certain subpopulations, for example those of a particular race, gender, or sexual orientation.  Since this past data may be biased, machine learning predictors must account for this to avoid perpetuating or creating discriminatory practices. In this paper, we develop a framework for modeling fairness using tools from causal inference. Our definition of counterfactual fairness captures the intuition that a decision is fair towards an individual if it  the same in (a) the actual world and (b) a counterfactual world where the individual belonged to a different demographic group. We demonstrate our framework on a real-world problem of fair prediction of success in law school.}

We show that both are possible for a class of decoders that we call additive, which are reminiscent of decoders used for object-centric representation learning (OCRL) and well suited for images that can be decomposed as a sum of object-specific images. We provide conditions under which exactly solving the reconstruction problem using an additive decoder is guaranteed to identify the blocks of latent variables up to permutation and block-wise invertible transformations. This guarantee relies only on very weak assumptions about the distribution of the latent factors, which might present statistical dependencies and have an almost arbitrarily shaped support. Our result provides a new setting where nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) is possible and adds to our theoretical understanding of OCRL methods. We also show theoretically that additive decoders can generate novel images by recombining observed factors of variations in novel ways, an ability we refer to as Cartesian-product extrapolation. We show empirically that additivity is crucial for both identifiability and extrapolation on simulated data.},

We propose a representation learning method that induces disentanglement by simultaneously learning the latent factors and the sparse causal graphical model that relates them. We develop a rigorous identifiability theory, building on recent nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) results, that formalizes this principle and shows how the latent variables can be recovered up to permutation if one regularizes the latent mechanisms to be sparse and if some graph connectivity criterion is satisfied by the data generating process. As a special case of our framework, we show how one can leverage unknown-target interventions on the latent factors to disentangle them, thereby drawing further connections between ICA and causality. We propose a VAE-based method in which the latent mechanisms are learned and regularized via binary masks, and validate our theory by showing it learns disentangled representations in simulations.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The occurrence of KRAS mutation is predictive of nonresponse and shorter survival in patients treated by anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibody for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), leading the European Medicine Agency to limit its use to patients with wild-type KRAS tumors. However, only half of these patients will benefit from treatment, suggesting the need to identify additional biomarkers for cetuximab-based treatment efficacy. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively collected tumors from 173 patients with mCRC. All but one patient received a cetuximab-based regimen as second-line or greater therapy. KRAS and BRAF status were assessed by allelic discrimination. EGFR amplification was assessed by chromogenic in situ hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization, and the expression of PTEN was assessed by immunochemistry. Results: In patients with KRAS wild-type tumors (n = 116), BRAF mutations (n = 5) were weakly associated with lack of response (P {$<$} .063) but were strongly associated with shorter progression-free survival (P {$<$} .001) and shorter overall survival (OS; P {$<$} .001). A high EGFR polysomy or an EGFR amplification was found in 17.7\% of the patients and was associated with response (P = .015). PTEN null expression was found in 19.9\% of the patients and was associated with shorter OS (P = .013). In multivariate analysis, BRAF mutation and PTEN expression status were associated with OS. Conclusion: BRAF status, EGFR amplification, and cytoplasmic expression of PTEN were associated with outcome measures in KRAS wild-type patients treated with a cetuximab-based regimen. Subsequent studies in clinical trial cohorts will be required to confirm the clinical utility of these markers. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

  abstract = {Few studies have assessed the extent and distribution of the blood-pressure burden worldwide. The aim of this study was to quantify the global burden of disease related to high blood pressure. Worldwide burden of disease attributable to high blood pressure (≥115 mm Hg systolic) was estimated for groups according to age (≥30 years), sex, and World Bank region in the year 2001. Population impact fractions were calculated with data for mean systolic blood pressure, burden of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and relative risk corrected for regression dilution bias. Worldwide, 7·6 million premature deaths (about 13·5\% of the global total) and 92 million DALYs (6·0\% of the global total) were attributed to high blood pressure. About 54\% of stroke and 47\% of ischaemic heart disease worldwide were attributable to high blood pressure. About half this burden was in people with hypertension; the remainder was in those with lesser degrees of high blood pressure. Overall, about 80\% of the attributable burden occurred in low-income and middle-income economies, and over half occurred in people aged 45–69 years. Most of the disease burden caused by high blood pressure is borne by low-income and middle-income countries, by people in middle age, and by people with prehypertension. Prevention and treatment strategies restricted to individuals with hypertension will miss much blood-pressure-related disease.},

  abstract = {This work aimed to develop a technique to measure stained areas in images from sample tissue sections, namely when the structure of interest does not fill the entire image field of the microscope. We propose a semiautomated computer-assisted image analysis (SACAIA) method in which brightfield color images of 3,3′-diaminobenzidene tetrahydrochloride (DAB)-stained antigens are converted to their blue component and boundaries are delineated to extract the object of interest. The number of pixels of a defined color (elicited by DAB) is counted and used to measure the stained area relative to the total area of the tissue under study. The percentages of area stained with adenosine A1 receptor were 40.76 ± 2.08 and 42.44 ± 2.26\% for manual analysis and SACAIA, respectively (P = 0.582). A strong linear correlation of A1 receptor quantification was found (r = 0.98, P \&lt; 0.001, and 95\% CI = 0.97 to 0.99 for manual method; r = 0.99, P \&lt; 0.001, and 95\% CI = 0.98 to 0.99 for SACAIA method). The extent to which misclassification affected staining quantification was evaluated by Bland–Altman analysis, indicating that this method can be applied accurately to quantify the immunohistochemical staining area (occupied by a specific antigen) in small sample tissues that do not fill the entire image field of the microscope.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disorder that requires lifelong treatment. We aimed to assess whether intensive weight management within routine primary care would achieve remission of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did this open-label, cluster-randomised trial (DiRECT) at 49 primary care practices in Scotland and the Tyneside region of England. Practices were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated list, to provide either a weight management programme (intervention) or best-practice care by guidelines (control), with stratification for study site (Tyneside or Scotland) and practice list size ({$>$}5700 or ≤5700). Participants, carers, and research assistants who collected outcome data were aware of group allocation; however, allocation was concealed from the study statistician. We recruited individuals aged 20-65 years who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the past 6 years, had a body-mass index of 27-45 kg/m2, and were not receiving insulin. The intervention comprised withdrawal of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, total diet replacement (825-853 kcal/day formula diet for 3-5 months), stepped food reintroduction (2-8 weeks), and structured support for long-term weight loss maintenance. Co-primary outcomes were weight loss of 15 kg or more, and remission of diabetes, defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of less than 6·5\% ({$<$}48 mmol/mol) after at least 2 months off all antidiabetic medications, from baseline to 12 months. These outcomes were analysed hierarchically. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 03267836. FINDINGS: Between July 25, 2014, and Aug 5, 2017, we recruited 306 individuals from 49 intervention (n=23) and control (n=26) general practices; 149 participants per group comprised the intention-to-treat population. At 12 months, we recorded weight loss of 15 kg or more in 36 (24\%) participants in the intervention group and no participants in the control group (p{$<$}0·0001). Diabetes remission was achieved in 68 (46\%) participants in the intervention group and six (4\%) participants in the control group (odds ratio 19·7, 95\% CI 7·8-49·8; p{$<$}0·0001). Remission varied with weight loss in the whole study population, with achievement in none of 76 participants who gained weight, six (7\%) of 89 participants who maintained 0-5 kg weight loss, 19 (34\%) of 56 participants with 5-10 kg loss, 16 (57\%) of 28 participants with 10-15 kg loss, and 31 (86\%) of 36 participants who lost 15 kg or more. Mean bodyweight fell by 10·0 kg (SD 8·0) in the intervention group and 1·0 kg (3·7) in the control group (adjusted difference -8·8 kg, 95\% CI -10·3 to -7·3; p{$<$}0·0001). Quality of life, as measured by the EuroQol 5 Dimensions visual analogue scale, improved by 7·2 points (SD 21·3) in the intervention group, and decreased by 2·9 points (15·5) in the control group (adjusted difference 6·4 points, 95\% CI 2·5-10·3; p=0·0012). Nine serious adverse events were reported by seven (4\%) of 157 participants in the intervention group and two were reported by two (1\%) participants in the control group. Two serious adverse events (biliary colic and abdominal pain), occurring in the same participant, were deemed potentially related to the intervention. No serious adverse events led to withdrawal from the study. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that, at 12 months, almost half of participants achieved remission to a non-diabetic state and off antidiabetic drugs. Remission of type 2 diabetes is a practical target for primary care. FUNDING: Diabetes UK.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, there has been increasing interest in the medical problems of performing artists. In this review, the major playing-related disorders seen in instrumental musicians are discussed. Among the 1353 instrumentalists personally evaluated, the major diagnoses included musculoskeletal disorders in 64\%, peripheral nerve problems in 20\%, and focal dystonia in 8\%. Of these instrumentalists, 60\% were women, although men were the majority in the group with focal dystonia. The average age at the time of evaluation was 37 years for men and 30 years for women. Among musculoskeletal disorders, regional muscle pain syndromes, particularly of the upper limb, upper trunk, and neck, were most common. Specific entities such as tendinitis and ligament sprain were less common. Frequent peripheral nerve disorders included thoracic outlet syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Each instrument group showed a characteristic distribution of symptoms and signs that appeared to be directly related to the static and dynamic stresses inherent in the playing of the instrument. Electrodiagnostic studies are an important part of the evaluation of these disorders, particularly nerve entrapment syndromes. With carefully designed treatment, the majority of instrumental musicians can return to full and pain-free playing. Nerve entrapment syndromes have the highest treatment success rate, followed by musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Despite some recent innovative approaches, focal dystonia remains largely resistant to therapy. Muscle Nerve 27: 549–561, 2003},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the initial SUVmax of  205 patients (112 adenocarcinomas, 82 squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs], and 11 of  other histology) with a stage IIIA NSCLC who underwent surgical resection after  neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and who were followed for up to 6 years. Clinical  data, including histologic type, pathologic response, and treatment, were reviewed,  and the relationship between the SUVmax and patient overall survival was examined.  RESULTS: Overall, the 2-year survival rate was 68\%. Between the two histologic  subtypes of adenocarcinoma and SCC, we noted significant differences in all  variables of gender (male predominance in SCC), initial SUVmax (greater in SCC),  pathologic response (more complete remission in SCC), and overall survival (better  in SCC) (all P values, {$<$} .05). SUVmax remained as a sole independent factor for  survival in multivariate analysis in whole series (SUVmax cutoff, 13; median  survival, 3.0 years vs. 4.0 years; P = .016) and in adenocarcinomas (SUVmax cutoff,  11.5; median survival, 2.6 years vs. 3.6 years; P = .045), but not in SCCs.  CONCLUSION: The initial SUVmax is a sole significant prognostic factor in patients  with a surgically resected NSCLC after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, particularly  in patients with an adenocarcinoma.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with waiver of patient informed consent. From January 2009 to December 2011, 1108 patients (633 male, 475 female; mean age, 62.4 years ± 12.3 [standard deviation]) with 1116 pulmonary lesions (mean size, 2.7 cm ± 1.7) underwent 1153 cone-beam CT-guided PTNBs. A coaxial system with 18-gauge cutting needles was used. Diagnostic performance, complication rate, influencing factors, and patient radiation exposure were investigated. Variables influencing diagnostic performance and complications were assessed by using uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 1153 PTNBs, pathologic analysis showed 1148 (99.6\%) were technically successful (766 malignant [66.4\%], 323 benign [28.0\%], and 59 [5.1\%] indeterminate). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosis of malignancy were 95.7\% (733 of 766), 100\% (323 of 323), and 97.0\% (1056 of 1089), respectively. In regard to diagnostic failures (five technical failures, 33 false-negative findings), lesions 1 cm in diameter or smaller and lesions in the lower lobe were significant risk factors (P = .028 and P = .034, respectively). As for complications, pneumothorax and hemoptysis occurred in 196 (17.0\%) and 80 (6.9\%) procedures, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed two or more pleural passages and emphysema along the needle pathway were the two most significant risk factors for pneumothorax, and ground-glass nodules were the most significant risk factor for hemoptysis (P {$<$} .001 for all). Virtual guidance was a significant protective factor for both pneumothorax and hemoptysis (P {$<$} .001 for both). Mean estimated effective radiation dose through cone-beam CT-guided PTNBs was 7.3 mSv ± 4.1. CONCLUSION: Cone-beam CT-guided PTNB is a highly accurate and safe technique with which to diagnose pulmonary lesions with reasonable radiation exposure.},

A meeting hosted by the German Cochrane Centre in 2004 brought together key methodologists in the area, many of whom became closely involved in the subsequent development of the methodological framework for DTA reviews.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Previous studies showed that the tumor  size and its metabolic activity are predictors of treatment outcome. We investigated  whether there are new metabolic prognostic factors of survival for stage III NSCLC  after definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 57  consecutive patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for their  stage IIIA (n=22) and stage IIIB (n=35) (AJCC 7th edition) unresectable NSCLC were  identified. A total of 43 (75.4\%) patients had positron emission tomography with  integrated computed tomography (PET-CT) scan performed at diagnosis that were  subsequently reviewed and analyzed. Prognosticators of progression-free survival  (PFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) were  analyzed. RESULTS: The median PFS, DMFS, and OS were 14.1, 12.6, and 37.8 months,  respectively, after a median follow-up of 41.5 months. PFS advantage was  demonstrated in stage IIIA versus stage IIIB (median 38.6 vs. 13.5 mo, P=0.020),  N-stage N0-N2 versus N3 (median 16.7 vs. 8.1 mo, P{$<$}0.001), planning target volume  (PTV) {$<$}500 versus ≥500 cm (median 23.6 vs. 11.3 mo, P=0.008), and the maximum  standardized uptake value (SUVmax) nodes {$<$}8 versus ≥8 (median 16.1 vs. 10.7 mo,  P=0.048). DMFS advantage was noted in those with PTV{$<$}500 versus PTV≥500 cm (median  13.0 vs. 11.3 mo, P=0.045) and SUVmax nodes {$<$}8 versus ≥8 (median 13.5 vs. 8.0 mo,  P=0.050). OS advantage was revealed in stage IIIA versus stage IIIB (median 56.5 vs.  22.7 mo, P=0.013) and SUVmax nodes {$<$}8 versus ≥8 (42.3 vs. 12.8 mo, P=0.009).  Multivariate analysis demonstrated that SUVmax nodes {$<$}8 was the only prognostic  factor of PFS, DMFS, and OS. Metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis were  not prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: SUVmax nodes {$<$}8 was the only prognostic factor  of PFS, DMFS, and OS in our study. PET-CT scan at the time of diagnosis is useful in  stratifying patients into favorable and unfavorable groups in stage III NSCLC  treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy.},

Deploying prognostic models into clinical workflows should change behavior and motivate interventions that affect outcomes. As users respond to model predictions, downstream characteristics of the data, including the distribution of the outcome, may change. The ever-changing nature of healthcare necessitates maintenance of prognostic models to ensure their longevity. The more effective a model and intervention(s) are at improving outcomes, the faster a model will appear to degrade. Improving outcomes can disrupt the association between the model’s predictors and the outcome. Model refitting may not always be the most effective response to these challenges. These problems will need to be mitigated by systematically incorporating interventions into prognostic models and by maintaining robust performance surveillance of models in clinical use. Holistically modeling the outcome and intervention(s) can lead to resilience to future compromises in performance.},

  abstract = {Real-world evidence is confounded by treatments, so data-driven systems can learn to recapitulate biases that influenced treatment decisions. This confounding presents a challenge: uninterpretable black-box systems can put patients at risk by confusing treatment benefits with intrinsic risk, but also an opportunity: interpretable “glass-box” models can improve medical practice by highlighting unexpected patterns which suggest biases in medical practice. We propose a glass-box model that enables clinical experts to find unexpected changes in patient mortality risk. By applying this model to four datasets, we identify two characteristic types of biases: (1) discontinuities where sharp treatment thresholds produce step-function changes in risk near clinically-important round-number cutoffs, and (2) counter-causal paradoxes where aggressive treatment produces non-monotone risk curves that contradict underlying causal risk by lowering the risk of treated patients below that of healthier, but untreated, patients. While these effects are learned by all accurate models, they are only revealed by interpretable models. We show that because these effects are the result of clinical practice rather than statistical aberration, they are pervasive even in large, canonical datasets. Finally, we apply this method to uncover opportunities for improvements in clinical practice, including 8000 excess deaths per year in the US, where paradoxically, patients with moderately-elevated serum creatinine have higher mortality risk than patients with severely-elevated serum creatinine.},

The first patient was transferred from a Greek hospital; his isolate belonged to an epidemic clone (multilocus sequence type 258) with a KPC-2 carbapenemase gene. The patient died from pneumonia. The other two patients, who had been travelling around in India, were found to be colonised in the gasto-intestinal tract with different multiresistant K. pneumoniae isolates containing a New Delhi metallo-carbapenemase gene (NDM-1). The rapid emergence and dissemination of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbapenems such as imipenem and meropenem poses a considerable threat to clinical patient care and public health. Carbapenemase-producing strains are characterized by resistance to nearly all available beta-lactam antibiotics including cephalosporins and carbapenems. These strains are often also resistant to other classes of antibiotics. Invasive infections by these strains are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Adequate microbiological laboratory detection and infection control measures in hospital are pivotal to preventing dissemination in the Dutch healthcare setting.},

  abstract = {Optimal treatment rules are mappings from individual patient characteristics to tailored treatment assignments that maximize mean outcomes. In this work, we introduce a conditional potential benefit (CPB) metric that measures the expected improvement under an optimally chosen treatment compared to the status quo, within covariate strata. The potential benefit combines (i) the magnitude of the treatment effect, and (ii) the propensity for subjects to naturally select a suboptimal treatment. As a consequence, heterogeneity in the CPB can provide key insights into the mechanism by which a treatment acts and/or highlight potential barriers to treatment access or adverse effects. Moreover, we demonstrate that CPB is the natural prioritization score for individualized treatment policies when intervention capacity is constrained. That is, in the resource-limited setting where treatment options are freely accessible, but the ability to intervene on a portion of the target population is constrained (e.g., if the population is large, and follow-up and encouragement of treatment uptake is labor-intensive), targeting subjects with highest CPB maximizes the mean outcome. Focusing on this resource-limited setting, we derive formulas for optimal constrained treatment rules, and for any given budget, quantify the loss compared to the optimal unconstrained rule. We describe sufficient identification assumptions, and propose nonparametric, robust, and efficient estimators of the proposed quantities emerging from our framework.},

Further investigation into the reasons for low elderly participation is warranted. Our objective was to evaluate the participation of the elderly in clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and assess the impact of protocol exclusion criteria on elderly participation. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis using NCI data, analyzing patient and trial characteristics for 59,300 patients enrolled onto 495 NCI-sponsored, cooperative group trials, active from 1997 through 2000. Our main outcome measure was the proportion of elderly patients enrolled onto cancer clinical trials compared with the proportion of incident cancer patients who are elderly. Results: Overall, 32\% of participants in phase II and III clinical trials were elderly, compared with 61\% of patients with incident cancers in the United States who are elderly. The degree of underrepresentation was more pronounced in trials for early-stage cancers than in trials for late-stage cancers (P {$<$} .001). Furthermore, protocol exclusion criteria on the basis of organ-system abnormalities and functional status limitations were associated with lower elderly participation. We estimate that if protocol exclusions were relaxed, elderly participation in cancer trials would be 60\%. Conclusion: The elderly are underrepresented in cancer clinical trials relative to their disease burden. Older patients are more likely to have medical histories that make them ineligible for clinical trials because of protocol exclusions. Insurance coverage for clinical trials is one step toward improvement of elderly access to clinical trials. Without a change in study design or requirements, this step may not be sufficient.}

  abstract = {Background Reliable predictive imaging markers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors are needed. Purpose To develop and validate a pretreatment CT-based radiomics signature to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced solid tumors. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a radiomics signature was developed in patients with advanced solid tumors (including breast, cervix, gastrointestinal) treated with anti–programmed cell death–1 or programmed cell death ligand–1 monotherapy from August 2012 to May 2018 (cohort 1). This was tested in patients with bladder and lung cancer (cohorts 2 and 3). Radiomics variables were extracted from all metastases delineated at pretreatment CT and selected by using an elastic-net model. A regression model combined radiomics and clinical variables with response as the end point. Biologic validation of the radiomics score with RNA profiling of cytotoxic cells (cohort 4) was assessed with Mann-Whitney analysis. Results The radiomics signature was developed in 85 patients (cohort 1: mean age, 58 years ± 13 [standard deviation]; 43 men) and tested on 46 patients (cohort 2: mean age, 70 years ± 12; 37 men) and 47 patients (cohort 3: mean age, 64 years ± 11; 40 men). Biologic validation was performed in a further cohort of 20 patients (cohort 4: mean age, 60 years ± 13; 14 men). The radiomics signature was associated with clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (area under the curve [AUC], 0.70; 95\% CI: 0.64, 0.77; P {$<$} .001). In cohorts 2 and 3, the AUC was 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.58, 0.76) and 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.56, 0.77; P {$<$} .001), respectively. A radiomics-clinical signature (including baseline albumin level and lymphocyte count) improved on radiomics-only performance (AUC, 0.74 [95\% CI: 0.63, 0.84; P {$<$} .001]; Akaike information criterion, 107.00 and 109.90, respectively). Conclusion A pretreatment CT-based radiomics signature is associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, likely reflecting the tumor immunophenotype. ©\,RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Methods: The prognosis  of 62 patients with advanced NSCLC who received anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)  in Henan Provincial People's Hospital from 2019 to 2021 were retrospectively  analyzed. The cachexia was evaluated before and after the second course of  immunotherapy. Kaplan-Meier and Log rank methods were used for survival analysis,  Cox regression model was used for multivariate analysis, and Spearman's correlation  analysis was used for correlation analysis. Results: After the second course of  immunotherapy, psoas major muscle area (PMMA) values of the cachexia group and the  control group were (14.10±4.09) and (11.66±3.22) cm(2) respectively, with statistics  significance (P=0.001). The level of Prealbumin and body weight were correlated with  cachexia (P{$<$}0.05). The 6-month and 1-year survival rates of 62 cases in the whole  group were 58.6\% and 42.5\%, respectively. The progression-free survival (PFS) in the  control group (7.6 months) was higher than that in the cachexia group (3.8 months,  P=0.006). The PFS in patients with high expression of PD-L1 (7.1 months) was longer  than that of patients with low expression (3.8 months, P=0.009). The overall  survival (OS) in the cachexia group (6.3 months) was lower than that in the control  group (18.2 months, P=0.006). The OS in patients with high expression of PD-L1 (14.5  months) was longer than that of patients with low expression (1 months, P=0.038).  The level of Prealbumin, the level of PD-L1 expression and the change rate of PMMA  were related to the OS of the patients (P{$<$}0.05). The level of Prealbumin and the  change rate of PMMA were the independent influencing factors of the OS (P{$<$}0.05).

This procedure uses moment-based statistics, m ≥ 3 repeated imputations, and an F reference distribution. When m = ∞, we show first that our procedure is essentially the same as the ideal procedure in cases of practical importance and, second, that its deviations from the ideal are basically a function of the coefficient of variation of the canonical ratios of complete to observed information. For small m our procedure's performance is largely governed by this coefficient of variation and the mean of these ratios. Using simulation techniques with small m, we compare our procedure's actual and nominal large-sample significance levels and conclude that it is essentially calibrated and thus represents a definite improvement over previously available procedures. Furthermore, we compare the large-sample power of the procedure as a function of m and other factors, such as the dimensionality of the estimand and fraction of missing information, to provide guidance on the choice of the number of imputations; generally, we find the loss of power due to small m to be quite modest in cases likely to occur in practice.}

  abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly being used to generate prediction models for use in a number of real-world settings, from credit risk assessment to clinical decision support. Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting, the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of such ‘naive updating’ when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen. We complement these findings with a discussion of several potential routes to overcome these issues.},

  abstract = {Purpose We evaluated the prognostic value of 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) PET/CT in patients with urological malignancies treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. Methods We prospectively recruited patients with advanced urological malignancies into a phase I trial of cabozantinib plus nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. NaF PET/CT scans were performed pre- and 8~weeks post-treatment. We measured the total volume of fluoride avid bone (FTV) using a standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold of 10. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients in terms of SUVmax, FTV, total lesion fluoride (TLF) uptake at baseline and 8~weeks post-treatment, and percent change in FTV and TLF. Result Of 111 patients who underwent NaF PET/CT, 30 had bone metastases at baseline. Four of the 30 patients survived for the duration of the study period. OS ranged from 0.23 to 34~months (m) (median 6.0~m). The baseline FTV of all 30 patients ranged from 9.6 to 1570~ml (median 439~ml). The FTV 8~weeks post-treatment was 56–6296~ml (median 448~ml) from 19 available patients. Patients with higher TLF at baseline had shorter OS than patients with lower TLF (3.4 vs 14~m; p\,=\,0.022). Patients with higher SUVmax at follow-up had shorter OS than patients with lower SUVmax (5.6 vs 24~m; p\,=\,0.010). However, FTV and TLF 8~weeks post-treatment did not show a significant difference between groups (5.6 vs 17~m; p\,=\,0.49), and the percent changes in FTV (12 vs 14~m; p\,=\,0.49) and TLF (5.6 vs 17~m; p\,=\,0.54) also were not significant. Conclusion Higher TLF at baseline and higher SUVmax at follow-up NaF PET/CT corresponded with shorter survival in patients with bone metastases from urological malignancies who underwent treatment. NaF PET/CT may be a useful predictor of OS in this population.},

  abstract = {Background Unplanned readmission of a hospitalized patient is an indicator of patients’ exposure to risk and an avoidable waste of medical resources. In addition to hospital readmission, intensive care unit (ICU) readmission brings further financial risk, along with morbidity and mortality risks. Identification of high-risk patients who are likely to be readmitted can provide significant benefits for both patients and medical providers. The emergence of machine learning solutions to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides unparalleled opportunities for developing an efficient discharge decision-making support system for physicians and ICU specialists. Methods and findings We used supervised machine learning approaches for ICU readmission prediction. We used machine learning methods on comprehensive, longitudinal clinical data from the MIMIC-III to predict the ICU readmission of patients within 30 days of their discharge. We incorporate multiple types of features including chart events, demographic, and ICD-9 embeddings. We have utilized recent machine learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), by this we have been able to incorporate the multivariate features of EHRs and capture sudden fluctuations in chart event features (e.g. glucose and heart rate). We show that our LSTM-based solution can better capture high volatility and unstable status in ICU patients, an important factor in ICU readmission. Our machine learning models identify ICU readmissions at a higher sensitivity rate of 0.742 (95\% CI, 0.718–0.766) and an improved Area Under the Curve of 0.791 (95\% CI, 0.782–0.800) compared with traditional methods. We perform in-depth deep learning performance analysis, as well as the analysis of each feature contribution to the predictive model. Conclusion Our manuscript highlights the ability of machine learning models to improve our ICU decision-making accuracy and is a real-world example of precision medicine in hospitals. These data-driven solutions hold the potential for substantial clinical impact by augmenting clinical decision-making for physicians and ICU specialists. We anticipate that machine learning models will improve patient counseling, hospital administration, allocation of healthcare resources and ultimately individualized clinical care.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a general approach for assessing the sensitivity of the point and interval estimates of the primary exposure effect in an observational study to the residual confounding effects of unmeasured variables after adjusting for measured covariates. The proposed method assumes that the true exposure effect can be represented in a regression model that includes the exposure indicator as well as the measured and unmeasured confounders. One can use the corresponding reduced model that omits the unmeasured confounder to make statistical inferences about the true exposure effect by specifying the distributions of the unmeasured confounder in the exposed and unexposed groups along with the effects of the unmeasured confounder on the outcome variable. Under certain conditions, there exists a simple algebraic relationship between the true exposure effect in the full model and the apparent exposure effect in the reduced model. One can then estimate the true exposure effect by making a simple adjustment to the point and interval estimates of the apparent exposure effect obtained from standard software or published reports. The proposed method handles both binary response and censored survival time data, accommodates any study design, and allows the unmeasured confounder to be discrete or normally distributed. We describe applications to two major medical studies.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The methods with which prediction models are usually developed mean that neither the parameters nor the predictions should be interpreted causally. For many applications, this is perfectly acceptable. However, when prediction models are used to support decision making, there is often a need for predicting outcomes under hypothetical interventions. AIMS: We aimed to identify published methods for developing and validating prediction models that enable risk estimation of outcomes under hypothetical interventions, utilizing causal inference. We aimed to identify the main methodological approaches, their underlying assumptions, targeted estimands, and potential pitfalls and challenges with using the method. Finally, we aimed to highlight unresolved methodological challenges. METHODS: We systematically reviewed literature published by December 2019, considering papers in the health domain that used causal considerations to enable prediction models to be used for predictions under hypothetical interventions. We included both methodologies proposed in statistical/machine learning literature and methodologies used in applied studies. RESULTS: We identified 4919 papers through database searches and a further 115 papers through manual searches. Of these, 87 papers were retained for full-text screening, of which 13 were selected for inclusion. We found papers from both the statistical and the machine learning literature. Most of the identified methods for causal inference from observational data were based on marginal structural models and g-estimation. CONCLUSIONS: There exist two broad methodological approaches for allowing prediction under hypothetical intervention into clinical prediction models: (1) enriching prediction models derived from observational studies with estimated causal effects from clinical trials and meta-analyses and (2) estimating prediction models and causal effects directly from observational data. These methods require extending to dynamic treatment regimes, and consideration of multiple interventions to operationalise a clinical decision support system. Techniques for validating 'causal prediction models' are still in their infancy.},

  abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, atrial endocardial catheter ablation, mainly targeting focal discharges in the pulmonary veins, is the most widely used interventional treatment of drug-refractory AF. Despite technical improvements, results are not yet optimal. There is ongoing search for alternative and/or complementary interventional targets. Conditions associated with increased sympathetic activation such as hypertension, heart failure and sleep apnea lead to structural, neural and electrophysiological changes in the atrium thereby contributing to the progression from paroxysmal to persistent AF and increasing recurrence rate of AF after PVI. Until now, interventional modulation of autonomic nervous system was limited by highly invasive techniques. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) was introduced as a minimally invasive approach to reduce renal and whole body sympathetic activation with accompanying blood pressure control and left-ventricular morphological and functional changes in resistant hypertension. This review focuses on the potential atrial antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects of RDN in AF patients with hypertension, heart failure, and sleep apnea and discusses the possible role of RDN in the treatment of AF.},

Nevertheless, intrarenal angiotensin II-related effects appear to be responsible for the rightward shift in pressure-natriuresis curves of TGR. To clarify the role of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system in modulating TGR pressure-natriuresis, TGR were given lifelong lisinopril by treating TGR and their mothers before conception. Rat and mouse renin, AT1 receptor, and angiotensinogen gene expression in the kidneys were studied with in situ hybridization. Neural and endocrine regulatory differences between TGR and Sprague-Dawley Hannover (SDH) rats were eliminated by renal denervation and infusion of vasopressin, aldosterone, 17-OH corticosterone, and norepinephrine. TGR with lisinopril had blood pressures similar to SDH. In TGR with lisinopril, the pressure-natriuresis curve was shifted leftward but not quite to the values observed in SDH given lisinopril. The histology of lisinopril-treated TGR was indistinguishable from normal SDH. Lisinopril increased rat renin and angiotensinogen gene expression both in SDH and TGR, but it did not influence mouse renin gene expression in TGR. Discontinuing lisinopril increased blood pressure in TGR and shifted the pressure-natriuresis relationship rightward. Thus, the components of the endogenous renin-angiotensin system and the mouse renin transgene were present and expressed in kidneys of TGR. The rat gene components responded to lisinopril as expected, but the mouse renin transgene expression was not influenced. Lisinopril normalized TGR blood pressure; however, a detectable leftward shift in pressure-natriuresis remained. These studies underscore the role of angiotensin-mediated effects of the mouse renin transgene in terms of shifting pressure-natriuresis in TGR.},

  abstract = {Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) are personalized virtual representations used to understand complex cardiac mechanisms. A critical component of CDT development is solving the ECG inverse problem, which enables the reconstruction of cardiac sources and the estimation of patient-specific electrophysiology (EP) parameters from surface ECG data. Despite challenges from complex cardiac anatomy, noisy ECG data, and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, recent advances in computational methods have greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ECG inverse inference, strengthening the fidelity of CDTs. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the methods of solving ECG inverse problem, the validation strategies, the clinical applications, and future perspectives. For the methodologies, we broadly classify state-of-the-art approaches into two categories: deterministic and probabilistic methods, including both conventional and deep learning-based techniques. Integrating physics laws with deep learning models holds promise, but challenges such as capturing dynamic electrophysiology accurately, accessing accurate domain knowledge, and quantifying prediction uncertainty persist. Integrating models into clinical workflows while ensuring interpretability and usability for healthcare professionals is essential. Overcoming these challenges will drive further research in CDTs.},

  abstract = {Aims Several microarray studies have reported microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures that classify cancer patients into different prognostic groups. No study has evaluated the association between miRNA expression patterns and gastric cancer prognosis. In this study, we developed a seven-miRNA signature that is closely associated with survival of patients with gastric cancer. Patients and methods MiRNA expression profile was analysed by real-time RT-PCR in 100 gastric cancer patients, which were randomly assigned to either the training set or the testing set. Cox proportional hazard regression and risk-score analysis were used to identify a stage-independent set of seven-miRNA signature in the training set that could classify patients with significantly different prognosis. This miRNA signature was further validated by the testing set and an independent cohort 60 patients. Results We have identified a seven-miRNA signature (miR-10b, miR-21, miR-223, miR-338, let-7a, miR-30a-5p, miR-126) for overall survival (p=0.0009) and relapse-free survival (p=0.0005) of gastric cancer patients. Multivariate analysis shown that the risk signature was an independent predictor of overall survival (HR=3.046; 95\% CI, 1.246 to 7.445, p=0.015) and relapse-free survival (HR=3.337; 95\% CI, 1.298 to 8.580, p=0.012). Furthermore, the predictive value of this seven-miRNA signature was validated in the testing set of 50 patients and an independent set of 60 patients. Conclusion Our seven-miRNA signature is closely associated with relapse-free and overall survival among patients with gastric cancer. The prognostic signature could be applicable to future decisions concerning treatment.},

It considers a modification of complete-case analysis that differentially weights the complete cases to adjust for bias. The basic idea is closely related to weighting in randomization inference for finite population surveys. Weighted complete-case estimators are often relatively simple to compute, but the computation of appropriate standard errors, even asymptotically, is less straightforward. Complete-case analysis is potentially wasteful for univariate analyses such as estimation of means and marginal frequency distributions, since values of a particular variable are discarded when they belong to cases that are missing other variables. The analyst wishes to associate a fixed sample size to each base as a check that the tables are correctly defined. The changes in the sample bases in available-case analysis prevent such simple checks.},

  abstract = {Predicting future outcomes is a prevalent application of machine learning in social impact domains. Examples range from predicting student success in education to predicting disease risk in healthcare. Practitioners recognize that the ultimate goal is not just to predict but to act effectively. Increasing evidence suggests that relying on outcome predictions for downstream interventions may not have desired results.  In most domains there exists a multitude of possible interventions for each individual, making the challenge of taking effective action more acute. Even when causal mechanisms connecting the individual's latent states to outcomes are well understood, in any given instance (a specific student or patient), practitioners still need to infer---from budgeted measurements of latent states---which of many possible interventions will be most effective for this individual. With this in mind, we ask: when are accurate predictors of outcomes helpful for identifying the most suitable intervention? Through a simple model encompassing actions, latent states, and measurements, we demonstrate that pure outcome prediction rarely results in the most effective policy for taking actions, even when combined with other measurements.  We find that except in cases where there is a single decisive action for improving the outcome, outcome prediction never maximizes "action value", the utility of taking actions. Making measurements of actionable latent states, where specific actions lead to desired outcomes, may considerably enhance the action value compared to outcome prediction, and the degree of improvement depends on action costs and the outcome model. This analysis emphasizes the need to go beyond generic outcome prediction in interventional settings by incorporating knowledge of plausible actions and latent states.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study aims to develop a CT-based radiomics model to predict clinical outcomes of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with nivolumab. Methods Forty-six stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients without EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement who received nivolumab were enrolled. After segmenting primary tumors depicting on the pre-anti-PD1 treatment CT images, 1,106 radiomics features were computed and extracted to decode the imaging phenotypes of these tumors. A L1-based feature selection method was applied to remove the redundant features and build an optimal feature pool. To predict the risk of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), the selected image features were used to train and test three machine-learning classifiers namely, support vector machine classifier, logistic regression classifier, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier. Finally, the overall patients were stratified into high and low risk subgroups by using prediction scores obtained from three classifiers, and Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was conduct to evaluate the prognostic values of these patients. Results To predict the risk of PFS and OS, the average area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of three classifiers were 0.73 ± 0.07 and 0.61 ± 0.08, respectively; the corresponding average Harrell’s concordance indexes for three classifiers were 0.92 and 0.79. The average hazard ratios (HR) of three models for predicting PFS and OS were 6.22 and 3.54, which suggested the significant difference of the two subgroup’s PFS and OS (p{$<$}0.05). Conclusion The pre-treatment CT-based radiomics model provided a promising way to predict clinical outcomes for advanced NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab.},

The histochemical method for demonstration of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) was also used to characterize NOS-containing neurons. All somata showing NOS immunoreactivity also displayed NADPH-d activity. The greatest number of neuronal somata were observed in groups at the wall of the renal pelvis and in the angular space formed by the pole of the renal parenchyma and renal pelvic wall. They were also seen at the renal hilus close to the renal artery and along the interlobar vasculature. The size of the neuronal somata in the 35-day-old rat ranged from 13.6 to 34.8 microns, with a mean size of 21.52 +/- 4.81 microns. Seventy percent, however, ranged in size from 17.8 to 26.8 microns. The shape of the neuronal somata also varied, with the majority having an ovoid or round shape. The distribution of the postganglionic fibers was investigated by means of the camera lucida. Postganglionic fibers projected into the wall of the renal pelvis and/or to the interlobar arteries extending to the arcuate arteries and to the beginning of the afferent arterioles. The NOS-immunoreactive neurons may have a vasodilator and relaxing function on the renal pelvic wall and vasculature. In addition, the presence of NOS-containing nerve fibers in nerve bundles, which are known to have predominantly vasomotor and sensory fibers, suggest that they may have a possible modulatory role on renal neural function.},

  abstract = {We present rectified flow, a surprisingly simple approach to learning (neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two empirically observed distributions \textbackslash pi\_0 and \textbackslash pi\_1, hence providing a unified solution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks involving distribution transport. The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \textbackslash pi\_0 and \textbackslash pi\_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that the procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification, turns an arbitrary coupling of \textbackslash pi\_0 and \textbackslash pi\_1 to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively applying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with a single Euler discretization step.},

We carried out a radiomics characterization from target lesions (TL) approach and largest target lesion (LL) approach on baseline and first follow-up (TP1) CT imaging data. Delta-radiomics feature was calculated as the relative net change in radiomics feature between baseline and TP1. Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression were applied for feature selection and radiomics signature construction.ResultsRadiomics signature at baseline did not show significant predictive value regarding response status for LL approach (P = 0.10), nor in terms of TL approach (P = 0.27). A combined Delta-radiomics nomogram incorporating Delta-radiomics signature with clinical factor of distant metastasis for target lesions had satisfactory performance in distinguishing responders from non-responders with AUCs of 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.75–0.91) and 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.68–0.95) in the training and test sets respectively, which was comparable with that from LL approach (P = 0.92, P = 0.97). Among a subset of those patients with available pretreatment PD-L1 expression status (n = 66), models that incorporating Delta-radiomics features showed superior predictive accuracy than that of PD-L1 expression status alone (P {$<$}0.001).ConclusionEarly response assessment using combined Delta-radiomics nomograms have potential advantages to identify patients that were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy, and help oncologists modify treatments tailored individually to each patient under therapy.}

  abstract = {The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.},

To date, there has not been any widely available method for estimating the benefits from adjuvant systemic therapy, in terms of long-term disease-free survival probabilities, in patients with primary breast cancer.             METHODS: Baseline prognostic information for primary breast cancer patients was estimated by asking 11 breast cancer specialists to complete a questionnaire on baseline prognosis and then using mean values. Data on the relative benefits of adjuvant therapy were culled from systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. A computer algorithm was developed to calculate 10-year absolute outcome data. Results from this evaluation were compared with a previously described actuarial algorithm.             RESULTS: Individual prognostic estimates varied within a group of breast cancer specialists, but mean values of their estimates closely followed published data. Translation of expected benefits of adjuvant therapy from relative to absolute terms was performed with a simple computer algorithm. The data were translated into tabular forms to facilitate user-friendly clinical use.             CONCLUSION: The provided data should facilitate a better understanding of the absolute magnitude of benefit for available systemic adjuvant therapies in individual women with primary breast cancer. This should allow patients to make more informed decisions about their options.},

A systematic review was conducted, searching PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL for protocols or reports of results of SMART designs and registrations of SMART designs in clinical trial registries applied to solid tumour research. After title/abstract and full-text screening, 33 records were included. Fifteen were reports of trials’ results, four were trials’ protocols and fourteen were trials’ registrations. The study design was defined as SMART by only one out of fifteen trial reports. Conversely, 13 of 18 study protocols and trial registrations defined the study design SMART. Furthermore, most of the records considered each stage separately in the analysis, without considering treatment regimens embedded in the trial. SMART designs in oncology are still limited. Study powering and analysis is mainly based on statistical approaches traditionally used in single-stage parallel trial designs. Formal reporting guidelines for SMART designs are needed.},

The most important aspect of inferring causal effects from observational data is the handling of confounders, factors that affect both an intervention and its outcome. A carefully designed observational study attempts to measure all important confounders. However, even if one does not have direct access to all confounders, there may exist noisy and uncertain measurement of proxies for confounders. We build on recent advances in latent variable modeling to simultaneously estimate the unknown latent space summarizing the confounders and the causal effect. Our method is based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) which follow the causal structure of inference with proxies. We show our method is significantly more robust than existing methods, and matches the state-of-the-art on previous benchmarks focused on individual treatment effects.}

Emphasising the parallels to randomisation may increase understanding of the underlying assumptions within epidemiology. An instrument is a variable that predicts exposure, but conditional on exposure shows no independent association with the outcome. The random assignment in trials is an example of what would be expected to be an ideal instrument, but instruments can also be found in observational settings with a naturally varying phenomenon e.g. geographical variation, physical distance to facility or physician's preference. The fourth identifying assumption has received less attention, but is essential for the generalisability of estimated effects. The instrument identifies the group of compliers in which exposure is pseudo-randomly assigned leading to exchangeability with regard to unmeasured confounders. Underlying assumptions can only partially be tested empirically and require subject-matter knowledge. Future studies employing instruments should carefully seek to validate all four assumptions, possibly drawing on parallels to randomisation.},

Stool samples and data on potential travel-associated risk factors (such as type of travel, nutritional habits, occurrence of gastroenteritis) were collected before and after traveling. Screening for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) was performed using selective media (CHROMagar™ ESBL/CPE plates). Isolates with confirmed ESBL-phenotype were examined for the presence of blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaVIM, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaKPC, blaOXA-48 genes by PCR amplification and sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using conventional microbroth dilution. Pre-travel analysis of 205 fully evaluable participants revealed an ESBL-PE prevalence rate of 6.8\% (14/205). Among 191 participants that were ESBL-negative before travel, 58 (30.4\%) were colonized by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, and 5 (8.6\%) additionally carried ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae upon return. However, no carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected. ESBL-genotyping revealed that 52/54 (96.6\%) E. coli and 4/4 (100\%) K. pneumoniae strains available for sequencing produced CTX-M enzymes, mostly CTX-M-15 (33/56, 58.9\%), and 2/54 (3.7\%) E. coli strains produced SHV-12 enzymes. Travel to India was associated with the highest ESBL-PE acquisition rate (11/15, 73.3\%; p=0.015), followed by South East Asia (22/46, 47.8\%; p=0.038).

Strictly practiced hand hygiene and exclusive consumption of packaged beverages showed no protective effect. The ESBL-PE persistence rate after 6 months was 8.6\% (3/35). We conclude that global efforts are needed to address the further spread of ESBL-PE in the community. Active surveillance and contact isolation precautions may be recommended at admission to medical facilities especially for patients who traveled to India and South East Asia in the previous 6 months.},

  abstract = {Prediction models are used among others to inform medical decisions on interventions. Typically, individuals with high risks of adverse outcomes are advised to undergo an intervention while those at low risk are advised to refrain from it. Standard prediction models do not always provide risks that are relevant to inform such decisions: for example, an individual may be estimated to be at low risk because similar individuals in the past received an intervention which lowered their risk. Therefore, prediction models supporting decisions should target risks belonging to defined intervention strategies. Previous works on prediction under interventions assumed that the prediction model was used only at one time point to make an intervention decision. In clinical practice, intervention decisions are rarely made only once: they might be repeated, deferred, and reevaluated. This requires estimated risks under interventions that can be reconsidered at several potential decision moments. In the current work, we highlight key considerations for formulating estimands in sequential prediction under interventions that can inform such intervention decisions. We illustrate these considerations by giving examples of estimands for a case study about choosing between vaginal delivery and cesarean section for women giving birth. Our formalization of prediction tasks in a sequential, causal, and estimand context provides guidance for future studies to ensure that the right question is answered and appropriate causal estimation approaches are chosen to develop sequential prediction models that can inform intervention decisions.},

  abstract = {It is widely known that neural networks (NNs) are universal approximators of continuous functions. However, a less known but powerful result is that a NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. Here, we thus extend this theorem to DNNs. We design a new network with small generalization error, the deep operator network (DeepONet), which consists of a DNN for encoding the discrete input function space (branch net) and another DNN for encoding the domain of the output functions (trunk net). We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations. We study different formulations of the input function space and its effect on the generalization error for 16 different diverse applications.},

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.},

The neural distribution at the segmental vessels and intrarenal vasculature has not been well characterized. Thus, we evaluated the autonomic nerve distribution from the great vessels to the renal cortex in a cadaveric model. We performed a detailed anatomical nerve dissection from the inferior mesenteric artery to the renal operculum in 2 human cadaveric torsos. Autonomic nerve fibers were verified by dissecting the greater splanchnic, sympathetic trunk and ganglia. We then systematically cross-sectioned the kidneys in 12, 1 mm slices across 3.6 cm, and stained the slices for histopathological analysis of neural tissue in relation to segmental arteries and other anatomical landmarks. Advanced reconstructive software was used to create a 3-dimensional computer image. Autonomic nerve fibers are located almost exclusively anteriorly on the main renal arteries and segmental arteries, and are absent from veins. Histopathology revealed that the intrarenal nerves continued to track exclusively with the arteries but were more circumferentially distributed. There is minimal nerve tissue around the veins. Many nerves were within a few millimeters of the renal collecting system. The autonomic nerves supplying the kidney maintain their distribution almost exclusively along the anterior surface of arteries as they pass from the aorta to the segmental arteries. Once inside the renal parenchyma, the nerves are circumferentially distributed around the renal arteries and are in close proximity to the renal collecting system.},

  abstract = {Background Locally advanced rectal cancer is usually treated with preoperative chemoradiation. After chemoradiation and surgery, 15–27\% of the patients have no residual viable tumour at pathological examination, a pathological complete response (pCR). This study established whether patients with pCR have better long-term outcome than do those without pCR. Methods In PubMed, Medline, and Embase we identified 27 articles, based on 17 different datasets, for long-term outcome of patients with and without pCR. 14 investigators agreed to provide individual patient data. All patients underwent chemoradiation and total mesorectal excision. Primary outcome was 5-year disease-free survival. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were computed and hazard ratios (HRs) calculated, with the Cox proportional hazards model. Subgroup analyses were done to test for effect modification by other predicting factors. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed for disease-free survival and overall survival with forest plots and the Q test. Findings 484 of 3105 included patients had a pCR. Median follow-up for all patients was 48 months (range 0–277). 5-year crude disease-free survival was 83·3\% (95\% CI 78·8–87·0) for patients with pCR (61/419 patients had disease recurrence) and 65·6\% (63·6–68·0) for those without pCR (747/2263; HR 0·44, 95\% CI 0·34–0·57; p{$<$}0·0001). The Q test and forest plots did not suggest significant interstudy variation. The adjusted HR for pCR for failure was 0·54 (95\% CI 0·40–0·73), indicating that patients with pCR had a significantly increased probability of disease-free survival. The adjusted HR for disease-free survival for administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was 0·91 (95\% CI 0·73–1·12). The effect of pCR on disease-free survival was not modified by other prognostic factors. Interpretation Patients with pCR after chemoradiation have better long-term outcome than do those without pCR. pCR might be indicative of a prognostically favourable biological tumour profile with less propensity for local or distant recurrence and improved survival.

  abstract = {Background Although CT-based body composition (BC) metrics may inform disease risk and outcomes, obtaining these metrics has been too resource intensive for large-scale use. Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P {$<$} .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12\,128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57\%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P {$<$} .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P {$<$} .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {Reasoning with counterfactuals is one of the hallmarks of human cognition, involved in various tasks such as explanation, credit assignment, blame, and responsibility. Counterfactual quantities that are not identifiable in the general nonparametric case may be identified under shape constraints on the functional mechanisms, such as monotonicity. One prominent example of such an approach is the celebrated result by Angrist and Imbens on identifying the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) in the instrumental variable setting. In this paper, we study the identification problem of more general settings under monotonicity constraints. We begin by proving the monotonicity reduction lemma, which simplifies counterfactual queries using monotonicity assumptions and facilitates the reduction of a larger class of these queries to interventional quantities. We then extend the existing identification results on Probabilities of Causation (PoCs) and LATE to a broader set of queries and graphs. Finally, we develop an algorithm, M-ID, for identifying arbitrary counterfactual queries from combinations of observational and experimental data, which takes as input a causal diagram with monotonicity constraints. We show that M-ID subsumes the previously known identification results in the literature. We demonstrate the applicability of our results using synthetic and real data.},

This multi-institutional  retrospective study investigated the outcomes of upfront surgery in patients with  clinical skip N2 disease (N2 disease without N1 disease) and a tumor in the right  upper lobe or left upper segment based on results of modern radiological  examinations, including positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: We identified  143 patients with cN2 disease who underwent upfront surgery in 12 institutions under  the Thoracic Surgery Study Group of Osaka University between January 2006 and  December 2013. Among 143 patients, 94 who underwent PET were analyzed. We classified  these patients into Group A (n=39; clinical skip N2 disease and a tumor in the right  upper lobe or left upper segment) and Group B (n=55; other). RESULTS: The median  follow-up was 56.5 months. Among the 94 patients, 50 (53.2\%) had skip N2 disease and  65 (69.1\%) had a tumor in the right upper lobe or left upper segment. The 5-year  overall survival (OS) rates of the 94 patients with cN2 disease was 47.9\%. The  5-year OS rates for the cN2pN0/1 (n=22) and cN2pN2 (n=70) groups were 74.9\% and  41.2\%, respectively (P=0.034). The univariate analysis of OS revealed no significant  differences in age, sex, histology, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, tumor  size, PET findings, and number of metastatic lymph nodes when these parameters were  dichotomized. A significantly better 5-year OS rate was observed in Group A than in  Group B (64.0\% vs. 37.0\%; P=0.039). The multivariate analysis of OS revealed that  Group A was a significantly prognostic factor (P=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with  cN2 disease in Group A had a more favorable prognosis. Upfront surgery may be a  treatment option for such selected patients with non-small lung cancer in the  specific group.},

Willis to the novel therapeutic manipulations, it is unanimously recognized that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) holds a crucial role in cardiovascular homeostasis. The introduction of sophisticated techniques, as microneurography and regional norepinephrine spillover provided the evidence for the role of sympathetic overactivity in various cardiovascular disease entities. Sympathetic activation is common in patients with essential hypertension and contributes to initiation, maintenance and progression of the disease and it contributes to the manifestation of its major complications. A considerable body of evidence relates SNS overactivity with high sodium intake in experimental animals and humans and the underlying mechanisms have nowadays been elucidated. SNS activity is more pronounced in patients with resistant hypertension and there are several conditions that lead to this phenomenon, as older age, kidney disease, obesity and metabolic syndrome, mental stress and sleep apnea. SNS overactivity holds also a key physiopathological role in heart failure, acute coronary syndromes and arrhythmias. Moreover, inhibition of sympathetic overactivity by various means, including central SNS suppressing drugs, peripheral alpha- and beta- adrenergic receptor blockers, or novel approaches as renal sympathetic denervation have been used successfully in the treatment of all these disorders.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Postoperative survival of patients with stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is highly heterogeneous. Here, we aimed to identify variables  associated with postoperative survival and develop a tool for survival prediction.  METHODS: A retrospective review was performed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and  End Results database from January 2004 to December 2009. Significant variables were  selected by use of the backward stepwise method. The nomogram was constructed with  multivariable Cox regression. The model's performance was evaluated by concordance  index and calibration curve. The model was validated via an independent cohort from  the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital Lung Cancer Center. RESULTS: A total of 1809 patients  with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC who underwent surgery were included in the training cohort.  Age, sex, grade, histology, tumor size, visceral pleural invasion, positive lymph  nodes, lymph nodes examined, and surgery type (lobectomy vs pneumonectomy) were  identified as significant prognostic variables using backward stepwise method. A  nomogram was developed from the training cohort and validated using an independent  Chinese cohort. The concordance index of the model was 0.673 (95\% confidence  interval, 0.654-0.692) in training cohort and 0.664 in validation cohort (95\%  confidence interval, 0.614-0.714). The calibration plot showed optimal consistency  between nomogram predicted survival and observed survival. Survival analyses  demonstrated significant differences between different subgroups stratified by  prognostic scores. CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram provided the individual survival  prediction for patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC after surgery, which might benefit  survival counseling for patients and clinicians, clinical trial design and  follow-up, as well as postoperative strategy-making.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Emerging evidence suggests muscle depletion predicts survival of patients with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At a cancer center in Alberta, Canada, consecutive patients with cancer (lung or GI; N = 1,473) were assessed at presentation for weight loss history, lumbar skeletal muscle index, and mean muscle attenuation (Hounsfield units) by computed tomography (CT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Concordance (c) statistics were used to test predictive accuracy of survival models. RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) distribution was 17\% obese, 35\% overweight, 36\% normal weight, and 12\% underweight. Patients in all BMI categories varied widely in weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation. Thresholds defining associations between these three variables and survival were determined using optimal stratification. High weight loss, low muscle index, and low muscle attenuation were independently prognostic of survival. A survival model containing conventional covariates (cancer diagnosis, stage, age, performance status) gave a c statistic of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.79), whereas a model ignoring conventional variables and including only BMI, weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation gave a c statistic of 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.88 to 0.95; P {$<$} .001). Patients who possessed all three of these poor prognostic variables survived 8.4 months (95\% CI, 6.5 to 10.3), regardless of whether they presented as obese, overweight, normal weight, or underweight, in contrast to patients who had none of these features, who survived 28.4 months (95\% CI, 24.2 to 32.6; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: CT images reveal otherwise occult muscle depletion. Patients with cancer who are cachexic by the conventional criterion (involuntary weight loss) and by two additional criteria (muscle depletion and low muscle attenuation) share a poor prognosis, regardless of overall body weight.},

  abstract = {Background Body mass index (BMI) is used to define obesity, but it is an imperfect measure of body composition. In the current study, the authors explored the association between types of fat and survival in patients treated with immunotherapy. Methods A retrospective analysis of 90 patients who were treated with immunotherapy on phase 1 clinical trials at the Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2009 through 2017 was performed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used to measure clinical outcomes. Baseline BMI and radiographic images at the middle of the third lumbar vertebrae were obtained. Fat densities were calculated and converted to indices (subcutaneous fat index [SFI], intermuscular fat index [IFI], and visceral fat index [VFI]) after dividing by height in meters squared. Risk groups were created using recursive partitioning and the regression trees method for SFI and IFI, which were selected by stepwise variable selection among all fat-related variables. The Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier method were used for the association with OS and PFS. Results The majority of patients (59\%) were male and diagnosed with melanoma (33\%) or gastrointestinal cancers (22\%). The median BMI was 27.4 kg/m2, the median SFI was 62.78, the median IFI was 4.06, and the median VFI was 40.53. Low-risk patients (those with an SFI ≥73) had a significantly longer OS (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.46 [P {$<$} .001]) and PFS (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.72 [P = .003]) compared with patients at intermediate risk (those with an SFI {$<$}73 and IFI {$<$}3.4) and poor risk (those with an SFI {$<$}73 and IFI ≥3.4). The Uno concordance statistics were found to be higher for fat risk groups than BMI in predicting OS (0.603 vs 0.574; P = .581) and PFS (0.602 vs 0.586; P = .71). Conclusions Increased BMI, increased SFI, and decreased IFI may be associated with prolonged survival in patients with cancer who are treated with immunotherapy. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effect of adiposity on the host immune response to immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is associated with poor outcome in cancer-patients. However, the methods to define sarcopenia are not entirely standardized. We compared several  morphometric measurements of sarcopenia and their prognostic value in  short-term-outcome prediction after pneumonectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive  lung-cancer patients undergoing pneumonectomy from January 2007 to December 2015 and  having a pre-operative computed tomography (CT) scan were retrospectively included.  Sarcopenia was assessed by the following CT-based parameters measured at the level  of the third lumbar vertebra: cross-sectional Total Psoas Area (TPA),  cross-sectional Total Muscle Area (TMA), and Total Parietal Muscle Area (TPMA),  defined as TMA without TPA. Measures were obtained for entire muscle surface, as  well as by excluding fatty infiltration based on CT attenuation. Findings were  stratified for gender, and a threshold of 33rd percentile was set to define  sarcopenia. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome  (ARDS), and 30-day mortality were assessed as parameters of short-term-outcome.  RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four patients with pneumonectomy (right, n\,=\,107; left,  n\,=\,127) were analysed. Postoperative mortality rate was 9.0 \% (21/234), 17.1 \% of  patients (40/234) experienced ARF requiring re-intubation, and 10.3 \% (24/234) had  ARDS. All parameters describing sarcopenia gave significant results; the best  discriminating parameter was TMA after excluding fat (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). While right sided  pneumonectomy and sarcopenia were independently associated to the three short-term  outcome parameters, Charlson Comorbidity Index only independently predicted ARF.  CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia defined as the sex-related 33rd percentile of fat-excluded  TMA at the level of the third lumbar vertebra is the most discriminating parameter  to assess short-term-outcome in patients undergoing pneumonectomy.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One-hundred and  eighty-six patients whose abdominal CT before the treatment was available were  enrolled into this study. The patients were divided into two groups of SMM according  to gender-specific thresholds for unilateral psoas area. Operability was judged by  the treating physician or thoracic surgeon after discussion in a multi-disciplinary  tumor board. RESULTS: Patients with low SMM tended to be elderly and underweight in  body mass index compared with the high SMM. Overall survival in patients with the  low SMM tended to be worse than that in the high SMM (41.1\% and 55.9\% at 5\,years,  P\,=\,0.115). Cumulative incidence of non-lung cancer death was significantly worse in  the low SMM (31.3\% at 5\,years compared with 9.7\% in the high SMM, P\,=\,0.006).  Multivariate analysis identified SMM and operability as significant factors for  non-lung cancer mortality. Impact of SMM on lung cancer death was not significant.  No difference in rate of severe treatment-related toxicity was observed between the  SMM groups. CONCLUSION: Low SMM is a significant risk factor for non-lung cancer  death, which might lead to worse overall survival, after SBRT for stage I NSCLC.  However, the low SMM does not increase lung cancer death or severe treatment-related  toxicity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abdominal surgery represents a physiologic stress and is associated with a period of recovery during which functional capacity is often diminished. "Prehabilitation" is a program to increase functional capacity in anticipation of an upcoming stressor. We reported recently the results of a randomized trial comparing 2 prehabilitation programs before colorectal surgery (stationary cycling plus weight training versus a recommendation to increase walking coupled with breathing exercises); however, adherence to the programs was low. The objectives of this study were to estimate: (1) the extent to which physical function could be improved with either prehabilitation program and identify variables associated with response; and (2) the impact of change in preoperative function on postoperative recovery. METHODS: This study involved a reanalysis of data arising from a randomized trial. The primary outcome measure was functional walking capacity measured by the Six-Minute Walk Test; secondary outcomes were anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life, and complications (Clavien classification). Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the extent to which key variables predicted change in functional walking capacity over the prehabilitation and follow-up periods. RESULTS: We included 95 people who completed the prehabilitation phase (median, 38 days; interquartile range, 22-60), and 75 who were also evaluated postoperatively (mean, 9 weeks). During prehabilitation, 33\% improved their physical function, 38\% stayed within 20 m of their baseline score, and 29\% deteriorated. Among those who improved, mental health, vitality, self-perceived health, and peak exercise capacity also increased significantly. Women were less likely to improve; low baseline walking capacity, anxiety, and the belief that fitness aids recovery were associated with improvements during prehabilitation. In the postoperative phase, the patients who had improved during prehabilitation were also more likely to have recovered to their baseline walking capacity than those with no change or deterioration (77\% vs 59\% and 32\%; P = .0007). Patients who deteriorated were at greater risk of complications requiring reoperation and/or intensive care management. Significant predictors of poorer recovery included deterioration during prehabilitation, age {$>$}75 years, high anxiety, complications requiring intervention, and timing of follow-up assessment. CONCLUSION: In a group of patients undergoing scheduled colorectal surgery, meaningful changes in functional capacity can be achieved over several weeks of prehabilitation. Patients and those who care for them, especially those with poor physical capacity, should consider a prehabilitation regimen to enhance functional exercise capacity before colectomy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is now good evidence in humans that a chronic systemic inflammatory response results in the cardinal features of cancer cachexia, principally the progressive loss of weight (in particular lean tissue). This review examines the role of recent simple objective systemic inflammation-based scores in predicting reduction of nutritional status and survival. RECENT FINDINGS: The most common measure of the systemic inflammatory response in cancer patients has been an elevated C-reactive protein concentration. This has now been included in recent definitions of cancer cachexia. There are also recent systemic inflammation-based scores, the Glasgow Prognostic Score, Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio and the Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio that have been shown to have prognostic value in cancer patients. These scores, in particular the Glasgow Prognostic Score, enable identification of patients who are, or likely, to develop cachexia, have a poor response to treatment and who are likely to have poor survival. SUMMARY: A chronic systemic inflammatory response is clearly implicated in the progressive nutritional and functional decline in the cancer patients and their subsequent poor outcome. Systemic inflammation-based prognostic scores not only identify patients at risk but also provide well defined therapeutic targets for future clinical trials targeting nutritional decline.},

Often initially reported studies of a marker show great promise, but subsequent studies on the same or related markers yield inconsistent conclusions or stand in direct contradiction to the promising results. It is imperative that we attempt to understand the reasons that multiple studies of the same marker lead to differing conclusions. A variety of methodological problems have been cited to explain these discrepancies. Unfortunately, many tumour marker studies have not been reported in a rigorous fashion, and published articles often lack sufficient information to allow adequate assessment of the quality of the study or the generalisability of the study results. The development of guidelines for the reporting of tumour marker studies was a major recommendation of the US National Cancer Institute and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (NCI-EORTC) First International Meeting on Cancer Diagnostics in 2000. Similar to the successful CONSORT initiative for randomised trials and the STARD statement for diagnostic studies, we suggest guidelines to provide relevant information about the study design, preplanned hypotheses, patient and specimen characteristics, assay methods, and statistical analysis methods. In addition, the guidelines suggest helpful presentations of data and important elements to include in discussions. The goal of these guidelines is to encourage transparent and complete reporting so that the relevant information will be available to others to help them to judge the usefulness of the data and understand the context in which the conclusions apply.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Minimally invasive surgery was adopted as an alternative to laparotomy (open surgery) for radical hysterectomy in patients with early-stage cervical cancer before high-quality evidence regarding its effect on survival was available. We sought to determine the effect of minimally invasive surgery on all-cause mortality among women undergoing radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. METHODS We performed a cohort study involving women who underwent radical hysterectomy for stage IA2 or IB1 cervical cancer during the 2010–2013 period at Commission on Cancer–accredited hospitals in the United States. The study used inverse probability of treatment propensity-score weighting. We also conducted an interrupted time-series analysis involving women who underwent radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer during the 2000–2010 period, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database. RESULTS In the primary analysis, 1225 of 2461 women (49.8\%) underwent minimally invasive surgery. Women treated with minimally invasive surgery were more often white, privately insured, and from ZIP Codes with higher socioeconomic status, had smaller, lower-grade tumors, and were more likely to have received a diagnosis later in the study period than women who underwent open surgery. Over a median follow-up of 45 months, the 4-year mortality was 9.1\% among women who underwent minimally invasive surgery and 5.3\% among those who underwent open surgery (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.22 to 2.22; P\,=\,0.002 by the log-rank test). Before the adoption of minimally invasive radical hysterectomy (i.e., in the 2000–2006 period), the 4-year relative survival rate among women who underwent radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer remained stable (annual percentage change, 0.3\%; 95\% CI, −0.1 to 0.6). The adoption of minimally invasive surgery coincided with a decline in the 4-year relative survival rate of 0.8\% (95\% CI, 0.3 to 1.4) per year after 2006 (P\,=\,0.01 for change of trend). CONCLUSIONS In an epidemiologic study, minimally invasive radical hysterectomy was associated with shorter overall survival than open surgery among women with stage IA2 or IB1 cervical carcinoma.

The "completeness" of renal nerve injury following renal denervation correlates with treatment-based variables such as the depth of ablation, the number of ablations along the length of the artery, and the number of renal arteries successfully ablated. Renal denervation techniques targeting only main renal arteries may lead to suboptimal results in patients with accessory renal artery anatomy. Technological differences among the different systems may make some more suited for this common anatomical variant. The early clinical experience with renal denervation of accessory renal arteries highlights the importance of complete renal denervation for clinical success.},

Taking advantage of the well-known relationship between the Wald and log likelihood ratio test statistics, we propose a complete-data log likelihood ratio based procedure. It is shown that, for any number of multiple imputations, the proposed procedure is equivalent in large samples to the existing procedure based on the point estimates and the variance-covariance matrices, yet it only requires the point estimates and evaluations of the complete-data log likelihood ratio statistic as a function of these estimates and the completed data. The proposed procedure, therefore, is especially attractive with highly multiparameter incomplete-data problems since it does not involve the computation of any matrices.}

  abstract = {Typical Bayesian methods for models with latent variables (or random effects) involve directly sampling the latent variables along with the model parameters. In high-level software code for model definitions (using, e.g., BUGS, JAGS, Stan), the likelihood is therefore specified as conditional on the latent variables. This can lead researchers to perform model comparisons via conditional likelihoods, where the latent variables are considered model parameters. In other settings, however, typical model comparisons involve marginal likelihoods where the latent variables are integrated out. This distinction is often overlooked despite the fact that it can have a large impact on the comparisons of interest. In this paper, we clarify and illustrate these issues, focusing on the comparison of conditional and marginal Deviance Information Criteria (DICs) and Watanabe–Akaike Information Criteria (WAICs) in psychometric modeling. The conditional/marginal distinction corresponds to whether the model should be predictive for the clusters that are in the data or for new clusters (where “clusters” typically correspond to higher-level units like people or schools). Correspondingly, we show that marginal WAIC corresponds to leave-one-cluster out cross-validation, whereas conditional WAIC corresponds to leave-one-unit out. These results lead to recommendations on the general application of the criteria to models with latent variables.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively validate the use of a simplified geriatric assessment (sGA) at diagnosis and to integrate it into a prognostic score for older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). METHODS: We conducted the prospective Elderly Project study on patients with DLBCL older than 64 years who underwent our Fondazione Italiana Linfomi original geriatric assessment (oGA) (age, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics, activities of daily living, and instrumental activities of daily living) before treatment. Treatment choice was left to the physician's discretion. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02364050). RESULTS: We analyzed 1,163 patients (median age 76 years), with a 3-year OS of 65\% (95\% CI, 62 to 68). Because at multivariate analysis on oGA, age {$>$} 80 years retained an independent correlation with OS, we also developed a new, simplified version of the GA (sGA) that classifies patients as fit (55\%), unfit (28\%), and frail (18\%) with significantly different 3-year OS of 75\%, 58\%, and 43\%, respectively. The sGA groups, International Prognostic Index, and hemoglobin levels were independent predictors of OS and were used to build the Elderly Prognostic Index (EPI). Three risk groups were identified: low (23\%), intermediate (48\%), and high (29\%), with an estimated 3-year OS of 87\% (95\% CI, 81 to 91), 69\% (95\% CI, 63 to 73), and 42\% (95\% CI, 36 to 49), respectively. The EPI was validated using an independent external series of 328 cases. CONCLUSION: The Elderly Project validates sGA as an objective tool to assess fitness status and defines the new EPI to predict OS of older patients with DLBCL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. It is hypothesized that oligometastatic disease represents a state of potentially curable, limited metastases. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an option for patients who are not amenable to or do not want resection. METHODS. From 2001 to 2006, 121 patients with ≤5 detectable metastases were enrolled in 2 prospective studies that used curative-intent SBRT. Most patients were treated with 10 fractions of 5 Gray. Stereotactic radiosurgery was offered to patients with brain metastases. RESULTS. The 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local control (LC), and distant control (DC) rates were 50\%, 26\%, 67\%, and 34\%, respectively; and the respective 4-year rates values were 28\%, 20\%, 60\%, and 25\%. A greater net tumor volume predicted significantly worse OS, PFS, LC, and DC. Patients with breast cancer fared significantly better with respect to OS, PFS, LC, and DC; and patients with adrenal metastases had significantly worse OS, PFS, and DC despite the small number of such patients enrolled. Neither the number of metastatic lesions nor the number of organs involved was a significant predictor of outcome. Among 45 patients who remained alive at the last follow-up, 29 patients had no evidence of disease, including 23 patients with ≥2 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. Oligometastatic disease is a potentially curable state of distant cancer spread. In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients with less volume burden of their metastatic disease and those with primary breast cancer fared better. SBRT delivered with curative intent in patients with limited metastases should be investigated further. The Southwest Oncology Group is developing a prospective protocol to treat women who have limited breast cancer metastases with SBRT. © 2007 American Cancer Society.},

This study aimed to  investigate the association of pretreatment sarcopenia and visceral obesity with  efficacy and prognosis of first- and second-generation epidermal growth factor  receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for patients with non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC) and positive EGFR mutation. METHODS: We retrospectively  collected 167 NSCLC patients with mutant EGFR who had started EGFR-TKI monotherapy  between October 2007 and August 2018 at our hospital. We classified 167 patients  into two groups, according to the definition of underweight based on the World  Health Organization (WHO) body mass index (BMI) classification and the Japanese  sex-specific cut-off values of the following computed tomography (CT)  images-assessed markers of pretreatment sarcopenia or visceral obesity, such as  psoas muscle index (PMI), intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC) and  visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VSR) at lumbar vertebra L3 level. We compared  overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of two groups by  Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard  analyses adjusted by age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, performance status, EGFR  mutation types and EGFR-TKI lines, and extra-pulmonary metastases or three or more  than 3 metastatic sites, we searched independent prognostic factors of OS and PFS of  EGFR-TKI therapy. RESULTS: The OS (median 26.0 vs. 32.3 months, P = 0.02) and PFS  (9.1 vs. 14.8 months, P = 0.03) of patients with BMI {$<$} 18.5 were significantly  shorter than those of patients with BMI ≥ 18.5. However, there was no significant  difference in OS and PFS according to PMI, IMAC and VSR. The multivariate analyses  detected only BMI {$<$} 18.5 as an unfavorable prognostic factor of shorter OS (hazard  ratio (HR) 1.70, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 - 2.81, P = 0.04) and PFS (HR  1.72, 95\% CI 1.11 - 2.67, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment underweight was a  significant prognostic factor of poor PFS and OS of EGFR-TKI therapy. However,  neither pretreatment sarcopenia nor visceral obesity was associated with prognosis  of EGFR-TKI. Underweight may be a surrogate for advanced disease burden.},

Adjusted by age, serum  albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), clinical stage and performance status, we  detected independent prognostic factors by multivariate Cox proportional hazard  analyses. RESULTS: We did not find any significant differences in OS and PFS between  two groups divided by BMI, PMI, IMAC and VSR. According to multivariate analyses,  none of BMI, PMI, IMAC and VSR was an independent prognostic factor of OS and PFS.  CONCLUSIONS: Neither pretreatment sarcopenia nor visceral adiposity is a prognostic  marker of patients with ED-SCLC treated with standard regimen of platinum-based  chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the association of computed tomography (CT)-assessed sarcopenia and visceral adiposity with efficacy and prognosis of  immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for pretreated non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC). METHODS: We retrospectively collected 74 patients with pretreated NSCLC who  had initiated programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand  1 (PD-L1) inhibitor monotherapy between December 2015 and November 2018 at our  hospital. As CT-assessed pretreatment markers, we used psoas muscle index (PMI),  intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC), visceral-to-subcutaneous ratio (VSR)  and visceral fat area (VFA) at lumbar vertebra L3 level. We divided 74 patients into  high and low groups according to each Japanese sex-specific cut-off value. Using  Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests, we compared overall survival (OS) and  progression-free survival (PFS). Adjusted by serum albumin, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte  ratio, performance status and driver mutations, multivariate Cox proportional hazard  analyses evaluated various variables as independent prognostic factors of OS and  PFS. RESULTS: We could not find significant difference in response rate (RR) and  disease control rate (DCR) between low and high groups according to any factors. The  OS of patients with body mass index (BMI) {$<$} 18.5 was significantly shorter than that  of patients with BMI ≥ 18.5 (median 3.3 vs. 15.8 months, P {$<$} 0.01), while there was  no significant difference in OS and PFS according to PMI, IMAC, VSR and VFA.  Multivariate analyses detected no significant prognostic factor in OS and PFS,  except for low IMAC (hazard ratio 0.43, 95\% confidence interval 0.18 - 0.998, P =  0.0496) as a favorable prognostic factor of longer OS. CONCLUSIONS: Neither PMI nor  VSR, VFA might be a significant prognostic factor of PFS and OS of ICI monotherapy  for pretreated NSCLC. According to our multivariate analyses, IMAC was a significant  prognostic factor of OS, but not of PFS. Thus, neither sarcopenia nor visceral  adiposity may be associated with the efficacy of ICI therapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the local/regional control, survival, and toxicity of combined-modality therapy using high-dose (64.8 Gy) versus standard-dose (50.4 Gy) radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 236 patients with clinical stage T1 to T4, N0/1, M0 squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma selected for a nonsurgical approach, after stratification by weight loss, primary tumor size, and histology, were randomized to receive combined-modality therapy consisting of four monthly cycles of fluorouracil (5-FU) (1,000 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 4 days) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) bolus day 1) with concurrent 64.8 Gy versus the same chemotherapy schedule but with concurrent 50.4 Gy. The trial was stopped after an interim analysis. The median follow-up was 16.4 months for all patients and 29.5 months for patients still alive. RESULTS: For the 218 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in median survival (13.0 v 18.1 months), 2-year survival (31\% v 40\%), or local/regional failure and local/regional persistence of disease (56\% v 52\%) between the high-dose and standard-dose arms. Although 11 treatment-related deaths occurred in the high-dose arm compared with two in the standard-dose arm, seven of the 11 deaths occurred in patients who had received 50.4 Gy or less. CONCLUSION: The higher radiation dose did not increase survival or local/regional control. Although there was a higher treatment-related mortality rate in the patients assigned to the high-dose radiation arm, it did not seem to be related to the higher radiation dose. The standard radiation dose for patients treated with concurrent 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy is 50.4 Gy.},

  abstract = {Patients have been observed with a chest pain syndrome after cardiac transplantation. For this pain to be cardiac in origin the afferent nerves carrying sensory information from the heart would have to reinnervate the heart. A previous study in dogs indicated that afferent reinnervation is uncommon during the first 2 years after transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether afferent reinnervation of the heart occurs in the long term. The decreases in arterial pressure and renal nerve activity resulting from chemical stimulation of left ventricular sensory receptors with vagal afferents with cryptenamine (veratrum alkaloid) were assessed in three dogs 8 to 12 years and in four dogs 6 to 8 weeks after cardiac autotransplantation and in six sham-operated dogs (thoracotomy-pericardiotomy 6 to 8 weeks before study). Responses of renal nerve activity to physiologic stimulation of cardiac receptors by volume expansion were also determined. Left ventricular cryptenamine inhibited renal nerve activity by 72 +/- 8\% in dogs with long-term and by 10 +/- 6\% in dogs with short-term autotransplantation and by 92 +/- 5\% in sham-operated dogs. Decreases in mean arterial pressure in these groups were 34 +/- 4, 11 +/- 3 and 67 +/- 16 mm Hg, respectively. Volume expansion inhibited renal nerve activity in long-term autotransplant (43\%) and sham-operated (48\%) groups but less in the short-term transplant group (33\%) for comparable increases in cardiac filling pressure. It is concluded that in dogs there is extensive afferent reinnervation of the long-term autotransplanted heart that results in relatively normal cardiopulmonary baroreflex responses to volume expansion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground The clinical benefit of preventive eradication of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations remains uncertain. A Randomised trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA) aims to compare the risk of death and symptomatic stroke in patients with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation who are allocated to either medical management alone or medical management with interventional therapy. Methods Adult patients (≥18 years) with an unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation were enrolled into this trial at 39 clinical sites in nine countries. Patients were randomised (by web-based system, in a 1:1 ratio, with random permuted block design [block size 2, 4, or 6], stratified by clinical site) to medical management with interventional therapy (ie, neurosurgery, embolisation, or stereotactic radiotherapy, alone or in combination) or medical management alone (ie, pharmacological therapy for neurological symptoms as needed). Patients, clinicians, and investigators are aware of treatment assignment. The primary outcome is time to the composite endpoint of death or symptomatic stroke; the primary analysis is by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00389181. Findings Randomisation was started on April 4, 2007, and was stopped on April 15, 2013, when a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health recommended halting randomisation because of superiority of the medical management group (log-rank Z statistic of 4·10, exceeding the prespecified stopping boundary value of 2·87). At this point, outcome data were available for 223 patients (mean follow-up 33·3 months [SD 19·7]), 114 assigned to interventional therapy and 109 to medical management. The primary endpoint had been reached by 11 (10·1\%) patients in the medical management group compared with 35 (30·7\%) in the interventional therapy group. The risk of death or stroke was significantly lower in the medical management group than in the interventional therapy group (hazard ratio 0·27, 95\% CI 0·14–0·54). No harms were identified, other than a higher number of strokes (45 vs 12, p\&lt;0·0001) and neurological deficits unrelated to stroke (14 vs 1, p=0·0008) in patients allocated to interventional therapy compared with medical management. Interpretation The ARUBA trial showed that medical management alone is superior to medical management with interventional therapy for the prevention of death or stroke in patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations followed up for 33 months. The trial is continuing its observational phase to establish whether the disparities will persist over an additional 5 years of follow-up.

However, researchers working with electrocardiogram (ECG) signals struggle to get access and/or to build one. The aim of the present work is to shed light on a potential solution to address the lack of large and easily accessible ECG datasets. Firstly, the main causes of such a lack are identified and examined. Afterward, the potentials and limitations of cardiac data generation via deep generative models (DGMs) are deeply analyzed. These very promising algorithms have been found capable not only of generating large quantities of ECG signals but also of supporting data anonymization processes, to simplify data sharing while respecting patients’ privacy. Their application could help research progress and cooperation in the name of open science. However several aspects, such as a standardized synthetic data quality evaluation and algorithm stability, need to be further explored.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) is used to assess the quality, risk of bias, and applicability of prediction models or algorithms and of prediction model/algorithm studies. Since PROBAST’s introduction in 2019, much progress has been made in the methodology for prediction modelling and in the use of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, techniques. An update to PROBAST-2019 is thus needed. This article describes the development of PROBAST+AI. PROBAST+AI consists of two distinctive parts: model development and model evaluation. For model development, PROBAST+AI users assess quality and applicability using 16 targeted signalling questions. For model evaluation, PROBAST+AI users assess the risk of bias and applicability using 18 targeted signalling questions. Both parts contain four domains: participants and data sources, predictors, outcome, and analysis. Applicability of the prediction model is rated for the participants and data sources, predictors, and outcome domains. PROBAST+AI may replace the original PROBAST tool and allows all key stakeholders (eg, model developers, AI companies, researchers, editors, reviewers, healthcare professionals, guideline developers, and policy organisations) to examine the quality, risk of bias, and applicability of any type of prediction model in the healthcare sector, irrespective of whether regression modelling or AI techniques are used.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Machine learning models have had discernible achievements in a myriad of applications. However, most of these models are black-boxes, and it is obscure how the decisions are made by them. This makes the models unreliable and untrustworthy. To provide insights into the decision making processes of these models, a variety of traditional interpretable models have been proposed. Moreover, to generate more human-friendly explanations, recent work on interpretability tries to answer questions related to causality such as "Why does this model makes such decisions?" or "Was it a specific feature that caused the decision made by the model?". In this work, models that aim to answer causal questions are referred to as causal interpretable models. The existing surveys have covered concepts and methodologies of traditional interpretability. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey on causal interpretable models from the aspects of the problems and methods. In addition, this survey provides in-depth insights into the existing evaluation metrics for measuring interpretability, which can help practitioners understand for what scenarios each evaluation metric is suitable.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased tumor size is a known risk for poor outcomes in patients with stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who are treated with surgery or  radiotherapy. However, there is limited information regarding the impact of tumor  size on the outcomes of patients with mediastinal lymph node involvement. We  conducted a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database analysis to  evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor size in patients with unresected stage  III NSCLC. METHODS: The SEER registry was queried for patients with unresected NSCLC  stage III and no malignant pleural effusion, aged 21 years or older, and diagnosed  between 1998 and 2003. Tumor size was defined as S1 (0.1-3 cm), S2 (3.1-5 cm), S3  (5.1-7 cm), and S4 (7.1-20 cm). Demographic variables included age, sex, race and  histology. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were estimated  by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used to  evaluate whether tumor size remained an independent risk factor in multivariable  analysis. RESULTS: A total of 12,315 patients met the eligibility criteria. Median  age at diagnosis was 70 years and most patients were men (58.7\%) and white (81.3\%).  Tumor size was an independent predictor for both OS (p {$<$} 0.0001) and DSS (p {$<$} 0.001)  in all subgroups of patients. CONCLUSION: Tumor size is an independent predictor for  OS and DSS in patients with unresected stage III NSCLC, and should be considered in  the stratification of patients treated in this setting after validation of this  finding in additional studies.},

Our objective was to evaluate clinically accessible methods to achieve practical and precise measures of body composition in cancer patients. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-based analysis of fat and fat-free mass was performed in 50 cancer patients and compared with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and with regional computed tomography (CT) images available in the patients' medical records. BIA overestimated or underestimated fat-free mass substantially compared with DXA as the method of reference (up to 9.3 kg difference). Significant changes in fat-free mass over time detected with DXA in a subset of 21 patients (+2.2 +/- 3.2\%/100 days, p = 0.003), was beyond the limits of detection of BIA. Regional analysis of fat and fat-free tissue at the 3rd lumbar vertebra with either DXA or CT strongly predicted whole-body fat and fat-free mass (r = 0.86-0.94; p {$<$} 0.001). CT images provided detail on specific muscles, adipose tissues and organs, not provided by DXA or BIA. CT presents great practical significance due to the prevalence of these images in patient diagnosis and follow-up, thus marrying clinical accessibility with high precision to quantify specific tissues and to predict whole-body composition.},

In particular, we show examples where such a combination discriminates between individuals who can benefit from a treatment and those who cannot – information that would not be revealed by experimental studies alone. We outline areas where this method could be of benefit to both policy makers and individuals involved.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the most common fatal malignancy in adults worldwide, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85\% of lung cancer diagnoses. Computed tomography is routinely used in clinical practice to determine lung cancer treatment and assess prognosis. Here, we developed LungNet, a shallow convolutional neural network for predicting outcomes of patients with NSCLC. We trained and evaluated LungNet on four independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC from four medical centres: Stanford Hospital (n\,=\,129), H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute (n\,=\,185), MAASTRO Clinic (n\,=\,311) and Charité – Universitätsmedizin, Berlin (n\,=\,84). We show that outcomes from LungNet are predictive of overall survival in all four independent survival cohorts as measured by concordance indices of 0.62, 0.62, 0.62 and 0.58 on cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Furthermore, the survival model can be used, via transfer learning, for classifying benign versus malignant nodules on the Lung Image Database Consortium (n\,=\,1,010), with improved performance (AUC\,=\,0.85) versus training from scratch (AUC\,=\,0.82). LungNet can be used as a non-invasive predictor for prognosis in patients with NSCLC and can facilitate interpretation of computed tomography images for lung cancer stratification and prognostication.},

  abstract = {Efferent renal sympathetic nerves reinnervate the kidney after renal denervation in animals and humans. Therefore, the long-term reduction in arterial pressure following renal denervation in drug-resistant hypertensive patients has been attributed to lack of afferent renal sensory reinnervation. However, afferent sensory reinnervation of any organ, including the kidney, is an understudied question. Therefore, we analyzed the time course of sympathetic and sensory reinnervation at multiple time points (1, 4, and 5 days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 wk) after renal denervation in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. Sympathetic and sensory innervation in the innervated and contralateral denervated kidney was determined as optical density (ImageJ) of the sympathetic and sensory nerves identified by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against markers for sympathetic nerves [neuropeptide Y (NPY) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)] and sensory nerves [substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)]. In denervated kidneys, the optical density of NPY-immunoreactive (ir) fibers in the renal cortex and substance P-ir fibers in the pelvic wall was 6, 39, and 100\% and 8, 47, and 100\%, respectively, of that in the contralateral innervated kidney at 4 days, 4 wk, and 12 wk after denervation. Linear regression analysis of the optical density of the ratio of the denervated/innervated kidney versus time yielded similar intercept and slope values for NPY-ir, TH-ir, substance P-ir, and CGRP-ir fibers (all R2 {$>$} 0.76). In conclusion, in normotensive rats, reinnervation of the renal sensory nerves occurs over the same time course as reinnervation of the renal sympathetic nerves, both being complete at 9 to 12 wk following renal denervation.},

Herein, we report a 18F-FDG-PET/CT-based deep learning model, which demonstrates high accuracy in EGFR mutation status prediction across patient cohorts from~different institutions. A deep learning score (EGFR-DLS) was significantly and positively associated with longer progression free survival (PFS) in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs, while EGFR-DLS is significantly and negatively associated with higher durable clinical benefit, reduced hyperprogression, and longer PFS among patients treated with ICIs. Thus, the EGFR-DLS provides a non-invasive method for precise quantification of EGFR mutation status in NSCLC patients, which is promising to identify NSCLC patients sensitive to EGFR-TKI or ICI-treatments.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy has improved outcomes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet durable clinical benefit (DCB) is experienced in only a fraction of patients. Here, we test the hypothesis that radiomics features from baseline pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT scans can predict clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients treated with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. METHODS: This study included 194 patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIB-IV NSCLC with pretreatment PET/CT images. Radiomics features were extracted from PET, CT, and PET+CT fusion images based on minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) criteria. The radiomics features from 99 retrospective patients were used to train a multiparametric radiomics signature (mpRS) to predict DCB using an improved least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, which was subsequently validated in both retrospective (N\,=\,47) and prospective test cohorts (N\,=\,48). Using these cohorts, the mpRS was also used to predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by training nomogram models using multivariable Cox regression analyses with additional clinical characteristics incorporated. RESULTS: The mpRS could predict patients who will receive DCB, with areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.86 (95\%CI 0.79-0.94), 0.83 (95\%CI 0.71-0.94), and 0.81 (95\%CI 0.68-0.92) in the training, retrospective test, and prospective test cohorts, respectively. In the same three cohorts, respectively, nomogram models achieved C-indices of 0.74 (95\%CI 0.68-0.80), 0.74 (95\%CI 0.66-0.82), and 0.77 (95\%CI 0.69-0.84) to predict PFS and C-indices of 0.83 (95\%CI 0.77-0.88), 0.83 (95\%CI 0.71-0.94), and 0.80 (95\%CI 0.69-0.91) to predict OS. CONCLUSION: PET/CT-based signature can be used prior to initiation of immunotherapy to identify NSCLC patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy. As such, these data may be leveraged to improve more precise and individualized decision support in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Pragmatic randomized trials are important tools for shared decision-making, but no guidance exists on patients' preferences for types of causal information. We aimed to assess preferences of patients and investigators toward causal effects in pragmatic randomized trials. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We (a) held three focus groups with patients (n~=~23) in Boston, MA; (b) surveyed (n~=~12) and interviewed (n~=~5) investigators with experience conducting pragmatic trials; and (c) conducted a systematic literature review of pragmatic trials (n~=~63). RESULTS: Patients were distrustful of new-to-market medications unless substantially more effective than existing choices, preferred stratified absolute risks, and valued adherence-adjusted analyses when they expected to adhere. Investigators wanted both intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects but felt methods for estimating per-protocol effects were lacking. When estimating per-protocol effects, many pragmatic trials used inappropriate methods to adjust for adherence and loss to follow-up. CONCLUSION: We made four recommendations for pragmatic trials to improve patient centeredness: (1) focus on superiority in effectiveness or safety, rather than noninferiority; (2) involve patients in specifying a priori subgroups; (3) report absolute measures of risk; and (4) complement intention-to-treat effect estimates with valid per-protocol effect estimates.},

Although many platinum-based two drug combinations with  third-generation agents are difficult to combine fully with thoracic radiotherapy  (TRT), a phase I study reported a full dose of cisplatin (CDDP) plus 80\% dose of  vinorelbine (VNR) was successfully combined with concurrent TRT. METHODS: Between  October 2000 and October 2004, 73 patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC treated  with CDDP, VNR, and concurrent TRT were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were  treated with CDDP 80 mg/m on day 1 and VNR 20 mg/m on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks.  Radiotherapy was administered concurrently in cycle 1. The total radiation dose was  60 Gy in 30 fractions. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0  were used to assess treatment-related adverse events. RESULTS: Median age was 63  years (40-78). Twenty-nine patients had adenocarcinoma, 63 were male, 47 ECOG PS 1,  and 47 stage IIIB. Median chemotherapy cycle was 2.0. Objective response rate was  93\% and median survival time was 21 months. Three-year overall survival rate was  33\%. Infield control rate was 71\%. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event was  leukocytopenia (67\%). Only 3 patients (4\%) experienced grade 3 esophagitis. One  patient died of radiation pneumonitis 87 days after completion of chemoradiotherapy.  CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with CDDP and VNR was highly active and  well-tolerated. This regimen could be used as a control arm in future trial for  stage III NSCLC.},

The purpose of this study  was to identify the risk factors, including sarcopenia, for postoperative  complications in patients undergoing a complete single-lobe thoracoscopic lobectomy  for clinical stage I NSCLC, as well as the impact of complications on disease-free  survival. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 173 patients with  pathologically-diagnosed NSCLC who underwent curative thoracoscopic lobectomies  between April 2013 and March 2018. Sarcopenia was assessed using the psoas muscle  index calculated from preoperative computed tomography images at the third lumbar  vertebral level. RESULTS: Complications developed in 38 (22\%) patients, including 21  with prolonged air leak. In univariate analysis, the significant risk factors for  complications were advanced age, male sex, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)  score, lower cholinesterase, lower albumin, higher creatinine level, pleural  adhesion, operative time\,≥\,five hours, nonadenocarcinoma cancer, and larger tumor  size. Multivariate analysis showed that age\,≥\,75\,years (P = 0.002) and pleural  adhesion (P =\,0.026) were significant independent risk factors for complications.  Compared with the patient group without complications, postoperative complications  were independently associated with shorter disease-free survival (P =\,0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age and pleural adhesion were independent risk factors for  complications after complete single-lobe thoracoscopic lobectomies for clinical  stage I NSCLC, and postoperative complications were statistically associated with  poor prognosis. Surgical teams should ensure an experienced surgeon leads the  operation for patients at higher risk to avoid prolonged postoperative  hospitalization and a possible poor prognosis.},

Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrated that BLR was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS (P = 0.017, P = 0.011, respectively). The high BLR group had higher levels of white blood cell count/neutrophil count and C-Reactive Protein than the low BLR group (P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with high BLR were associated with poor PFS and OS, potentially explained by evidence of systemic inflammation known to be associated with immunosuppression.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Skeletal muscle depletion, referred to as sarcopenia, has recently been identified as a risk factor for poor outcomes in various malignancies. However,  the prognostic significance of sarcopenia in patients with NSCLC after surgery has  not been adequately determined. This study investigated the impact of sarcopenia in  patients undergoing pulmonary resection for lung cancer. METHODS: This retrospective  study consisted of 328 patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC who underwent  curative resection between January 2005 and April 2017. Preoperative computed  tomography imaging at the third lumbar vertebrae level was assessed to measure the  psoas muscle mass index (PMI, cm(2)/m(2)). Sarcopenia was defined as a cutoff value  of PMI less than 6.36 cm(2)/m(2) for males and 3.92 cm(2)/m(2) for females, based on  PMI values from "healthy" subjects. RESULTS: The median patient age was 71 years and  59\% were male. Sarcopenia was present in 183 (55.8\%) and was significantly related  with increasing age (p {$<$} 0.001), being male (p {$<$} 0.001), smoking habit (p {$<$} 0.001),  lower body mass index (p {$<$} 0.001), and postoperative major complication  (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3, p~= 0.036). The prevalence of sarcopenia was higher in men  than in women, and the prevalence increased with age in men, whereas the prevalence  did not increase in females older than 70 years. The 5-year survival rate was 61\% in  patients with sarcopenia and 91\% in those without. Multivariate analysis revealed  that sarcopenia was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor (p~= 0.019).  CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia as determined using preoperative computed tomography could  be used to predict postoperative major complication and prognosis in patients with  resected NSCLC. Our results may provide some important information for preoperative  management.},

  abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade is an emerging anticancer strategy, and Nivolumab is a human mAb to PD-1 that is used in the treatment of a number of different malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), kidney cancer, urothelial carcinoma and melanoma. Although the use of Nivolumab prolongs survival in a number of patients, this treatment is hampered by high cost. Therefore, the identification of predictive markers of response to treatment in patients is required. In this context, PD-1/PDL1 blockade antitumor effects occur through the reactivation of a pre-existing immune response, and the efficacy of these effects is strictly associated with the presence of necrosis, hypoxia and inflammation at the tumour sites. It has been indicated that these events can be evaluated by specific assessments using a computed tomography (CT) texture analysis (TA) or radiomics. Therefore, a retrospective study was performed, which aimed to evaluate the potential use of this analysis in the identification of patients with NSCLC who may benefit from Nivolumab treatment. A retrospective analysis was performed of 59 patients with metastatic NSCLC who received Nivolumab treatment between January 2015 and July 2017 at Siena University Hospital (35 patients, training dataset), Catanzaro University Hospital and Reggio Calabria Grand Metropolitan Hospital, Italy (24 patients, validation dataset). Pre- and post-contrast CT sequences were used to contour the gross tumour volume (GTV) of the target lesions prior to Nivolumab treatment. The impact of variations on contouring was analysed using two delineations, which were performed on each patient, and the TA parameters were tested for reliability using the Intraclass Coefficient Correlation method (ICC). All analyses for the current study were performed using LifeX Software©. Imaging, clinical and pathological parameters were correlated with progression free survival and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan Meier analysis. An external validation testing was performed for the TA Score using the validation dataset. A total of 59 patients were included in the analysis of the present study. The reliability ICC analysis of 14 TA parameters indicated a highly reproducibility (ICC {$>$}0.70, single measure) in 12 (85\%) pre- contrast and 13 (93\%) post-contrast exams. A specific cut-off was detected for each of the following parameters: volume (score 1 {$>$}36 ml), histogram entropy (score 1 {$>$} 1.30), compacity (score 1 {$<$}3), gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-entropy (score 1 {$>$}1.80), GLCM-Dissimilarity (score 1 {$>$}5) and GLCM-Correlation (score 1{$<$}0.54). The global texture score allowed the classification of two subgroups of Low (Score 0–1; 36 patients; 61\%) and High Risk patients (Score {$>$}1; 23 patients; 39\%) that respectively, showed a median OS of 26 (mean +/- SD: 18 +/- 1.98 months; 95\% CI 14–21 months) and 5 months (mean +/- SD: 6 +/- 0.99 months; 95\% CI: 4–8 months; P=0.002). The current study indicated that TA parameters can identify patients that will benefit from PD-1 blockage by defining the radiological settings that are potentially suggestive of an active immune response. These results require further confirmation in prospective trials.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Cachexia and sarcopenia are associated with poor outcome and increased chemotherapy-induced toxicity in lung cancer patients. However, the complex interplay of obesity, sarcopenia and cachexia, and its impact on survival in the context of first-line-chemotherapy is not yet understood. Methods: In 200 consecutively recruited lung cancer patients (70 female, mean age 62y; mean BMI 25 kg/m2; median follow-up 15.97 months) with routine staging-CT before and after chemotherapy (CTX, mean interval: 4.3 months), densitometric quantification of total (TFA), visceral (VFA), and subcutaneous-fat-area (SFA), inter-muscular-fat-area (IMFA), muscle-density (MD), muscle-area (MA) and skeletal-muscle-index (SMI) was performed retrospectively to evaluate changes under chemotherapy and the impact on survival. Results: We observed increases in TFA, VFA, SFA, VFA/SFA, and IMFA (p\&lt;0.05-0.001), while there were decreases in MA, MD and BMI (p\&lt;0.05-0.001) after chemotherapy. High pre-therapeutic VFA/SFA was a predictive factor for poor survival (HR = 1.272; p = 0.008), high pre-therapeutic MD for improved survival (HR = 0.93; p\&lt;0.05). Decrease in BMI (HR = 1.303; p\&lt;0.001), weight (HR = 1.067; p\&lt;0.001) and SMI (HR = 1.063; p\&lt;0.001) after chemotherapy were associated with poor survival. Patients with ≥4 CTX-cycles showed increased survival (17.6 vs. 9.1months), less muscle depletion (SMIdifference: p\&lt;0.05) and no BMI loss (BMIdifference: p\&lt;0.001). Conclusions: After chemotherapy, patients exhibited sarcopenia with decreased muscle and increased adipose tissue compartments, which was not adequately mirrored by BMI and weight loss but by imaging. Particularly sarcopenic patients received less CTX-cycles and had poorer survival. As loss of BMI, weight and muscle were associated with poor survival, early detection (via imaging) and prevention (via physical exercise and nutrition) of sarcopenia may potentially improve outcome and reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity. © 2017 Nattenmüller et al.

  abstract = {In estrogen-receptor-positive, HER2-negative (ER+HER2−) breast cancer, higher levels of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are often associated with a poor prognosis and this phenomenon is still poorly understood. Fibroblasts represent one of the most frequent cells in breast cancer and harbor immunomodulatory capabilities. Here, we evaluate the molecular and clinical impact of the spatial patterns of TILs and fibroblast in ER+HER2− breast cancer. We used a deep neural network to locate and identify tumor, TILs, and fibroblasts on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from 179 ER+HER2− breast tumors (ICGC cohort) together with a new density estimation analysis to measure the spatial patterns. We clustered tumors based on their spatial patterns and gene set enrichment analysis was performed to study their molecular characteristics. We independently assessed the spatial patterns in a second cohort of ER+HER2− breast cancer (N\,=\,630, METABRIC) and studied their prognostic value. The spatial integration of fibroblasts, TILs, and tumor cells leads to a new reproducible spatial classification of ER+HER2− breast cancer and is linked to inflammation, fibroblast meddling, or immunosuppression. ER+HER2− patients with high TIL did not have a significant improved overall survival (HR\,=\,0.76, P\,=\,0.212), except when they had received chemotherapy (HR\,=\,0.447). A poorer survival was observed for patients with high fibroblasts that did not show a high level of TILs (HR\,=\,1.661, P\,=\,0.0303). Especially spatial mixing of fibroblasts and TILs was associated with a good prognosis (HR\,=\,0.464, P\,=\,0.013). Our findings demonstrate a reproducible pipeline for the spatial profiling of TILs and fibroblasts in ER+HER2− breast cancer and suggest that this spatial interplay holds a decisive role in their cancer-immune interactions.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel versatile approach based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models for ECG synthesis, addressing three scenarios: (i) heartbeat generation, (ii) partial signal imputation, and (iii) full heartbeat forecasting. Our approach presents the first generalized conditional approach for ECG synthesis, and our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness for various ECG-related tasks. Moreover, we show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art ECG generative models and can enhance the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The immune maladaptation theory suggests that tolerance to paternal antigens, resulting from prolonged exposure to sperm, protects against the development of preeclampsia. We tested whether barrier contraception and shorter sexual experience with the father of the pregnancy would increase the risk of preeclampsia. METHODS: Of 2211 women delivering singleton births after enrollment in a pregnancy cohort study, 85 (3.8\%) developed preeclampsia as defined by antepartum systolic blood pressure {$>$} or = 140 or diastolic blood pressure {$>$} or = 90 plus proteinuria. At a mean of 10.2 weeks of gestation, all women in the cohort were asked about preconception contraception and timing of first sexual intercourse with the father of the pregnancy. Odds ratios (OR) comparing cases with preeclampsia to the rest of the cohort were adjusted for age, smoking, parity, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Women using barrier contraception prior to conception were no more likely than women not using barrier contraception to develop preeclampsia (adjusted OR 1.0, 95\% CI 0.6-1.6). In unadjusted analyses, a prolonged time to conception was associated with preeclampsia (OR 1.9), however, after adjustment, the association was less prominent (OR 1.6) and after stratification by contraception method, the link between time to conception and preeclampsia was eliminated. CONCLUSION: These data do not support the immune maladaptation theory of preeclampsia.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) are relatively new MR techniques increasingly used in acute stroke. During the first hours of stroke evolution, the regions with abnormal perfusion are typically larger than the DWI lesions, and this mismatch region has been suggested to be “tissue at risk.” The aim of this study was to evaluate the PWI/DWI mismatch region in acute stroke patients and find parameters indicative of both infarct progression and functional impairment. Methods—Twenty patients with nonlacunar ischemic stroke were imaged with DWI, PWI, and conventional MRI within 24 hours of symptom onset and after 1 week; in addition, the European Stroke Scale (ESS) score was recorded. With PWI, the volumes of regions with “time-to-peak” (TTP) delays of ≥2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 seconds were measured; these volumes were compared with the acute DWI lesion volumes, final infarct size, and ESS score. Results—In 80\% of patients the acute DWI lesion was surrounded by regions with abnormal TTP delays (PWI{$>$}DWI lesion). A TTP delay of ≥6 s in the mismatch region was found to be associated with lesion enlargement between the initial and follow-up MRI scans. Lesions increased in 9 of 12 patients (75\%) in whom the area with TTP delay ≥6 s was larger than the DWI lesion, but they increased in only 1 of 8 (12.5\%) of the remaining patients, in whom the area with a TTP delay ≥6 s was smaller than the DWI lesion. The volume of the regions with TTP delays of ≥4 s correlated better with ESS (r=−0.88, P{$<$}0.001) than other PWI (or DWI) volumes, which indicated that a TTP delay of ≈4 s might be the threshold for functional impairment of brain tissue. Conclusions—Only patients with severe perfusion deficits in the PWI/DWI mismatch (TTP delays of ≥6 s) are at high risk of lesion enlargement. Functionally, more moderate perfusion deficits (TTP delays ≥4 and {$<$}6 s) appear to also contribute to the acute clinical deficit.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We report long-term disease control, survival, and toxicity for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer prospectively treated with  concurrent proton therapy and chemotherapy on a nonrandomized case-only  observational study. METHODS: All patients received passive-scatter proton therapy,  planned with 4D-CT-based simulation; all received proton therapy concurrent with  weekly chemotherapy. Endpoints were local and distant control, disease-free survival  (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The 134 patients (21 stage II, 113 stage  III; median age 69 years) had a median gross tumor volume (GTV) of 70 cm(3) (range,  5-753 cm(3)); 77 patients (57\%) received 74 Gy(RBE), and 57 (42\%) received 60-72  Gy(RBE) (range, 60-74.1 Gy(RBE)). At a median follow-up time of 4.7 years, median OS  times were 40.4 months (stage II) and 30.4 months (stage III). Five-year DFS rates  were 17.3\% (stage II) and 18.0\% (stage III). OS, DFS, and local and distant control  rates at 5 years did not differ by disease stage. Age and GTV were related to OS and  DFS. Toxicity was tolerable, with 1 grade 4 esophagitis and 16 grade 3 events (2  pneumonitis, 6 esophagitis, 8 dermatitis). CONCLUSION: This report of outcomes after  proton therapy for 134 patients indicated that this regimen produced excellent OS  with tolerable toxicity.},

  abstract = {Automated generation of medical reports that describe the findings in the medical images helps radiologists by alleviating their workload. Medical report generation system should generate correct and concise reports. However, data imbalance makes it difficult to train models accurately. Medical datasets are commonly imbalanced in their finding labels because incidence rates differ among diseases; moreover, the ratios of abnormalities to normalities are significantly imbalanced. We propose a novel reinforcement learning method with a reconstructor to improve the clinical correctness of generated reports to train the data-to-text module with a highly imbalanced dataset. Moreover, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy for reinforcement learning to additionally train the model on infrequent findings. From the perspective of a practical use, we employ a Two-Stage Medical Report Generator (TS-MRGen) for controllable report generation from input images. TS-MRGen consists of two separated stages: an image diagnosis module and a data-to-text module. Radiologists can modify the image diagnosis module results to control the reports that the data-to-text module generates. We conduct an experiment with two medical datasets to assess the data-to-text module and the entire two-stage model. Results demonstrate that the reports generated by our model describe the findings in the input image more correctly.},

Several studies have reported that secondary sarcopenia is an  indicator of postoperative recurrence. We hypothesized that there is a correlation  between the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and sarcopenia. We  retrospectively analyzed 38 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) who were treated with ICIs between February 2016 and April 2018. Patients  were divided into two groups according to the change rate of the psoas major muscle  area (PMMA) at the L2-L3 position and investigated the correlation between the  change rate of the PMMA and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated. The objective  response and disease control rates were lower in patients with sarcopenia than in  those without sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia exhibited a significantly shorter  median progression-free survival (PFS) than non-sarcopenia patients. Moreover,  focusing on good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status patients,  sarcopenia patients showed a shorter PFS than non-sarcopenia patients. Patients with  sarcopenia are associated with poor outcomes for immunotherapy among those with  advanced NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis. Further research is needed to  validate the clinical biomarkers involved in ICI responders.},

Methods~         Forty patients who underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans before and after therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors from December 2013 to December 2016 were retrospectively enrolled (malignant melanoma, n = 21; malignant lymphoma, n = 11; renal cell carcinoma, n = 8). SUVmax of the baseline and first restaging scans were evaluated in tumors, spleen, bone marrow, thyroid and pituitary glands, and were correlated to best overall response in the first year after therapy; IRAE-affected areas were also evaluated.         Results~         Interval change between the baseline and first restaging scans showed that patients with a clinical benefit had a significant decrease in tumor parameters (P {$<$} 0.001). All patients with an increase of SUVmax in the thyroid of more than 1.5 (n = 5) on the first restaging scan had a complete response (CR) in 1 year. Patients with CR within 1 year (n = 22) were significantly associated with a favorable long-term outcome (P = 0.002). Nine patients with IRAE findings had CR at final evaluation. Among IRAE, thyroiditis was seen significantly earlier than arthritis (P = 0.040).         Conclusions~         The decrease of tumor parameters at early time-point PET scans was seen in patients with immunotherapy who had clinical benefit within 1 year. PET-detectable IRAE was useful for prediction of a favorable outcome. Early development of thyroiditis may particularly represent an early response indicator to immunotherapy.},

Launched by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, the GetReal project aims to improve understanding of how to reconcile evidence to support efficacy and effectiveness and at proposing operational solutions. Objectives The objectives of the present narrative review were 1) to understand the historical background in which the concept of the EEG has emerged and 2) to describe the conceptualization of EEG. Methods A focused literature review was conducted across the gray literature and articles published in English reporting insights on the EEG concept. The identification of different “paradigms” was performed by simple inductive analysis of the documents’ content. Results The literature on the EEG falls into three major paradigms, in which EEG is related to 1) real-life characteristics of the health care system; 2) the method used to measure the drug’s effect; and 3) a complex interaction between the drug’s biological effect and contextual factors. Conclusions The third paradigm provides an opportunity to look beyond any dichotomy between “standardized” versus “real-life” characteristics of the health care system and study designs. Namely, future research will determine whether the identification of these contextual factors can help to best design randomized controlled trials that provide better estimates of drugs’ effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of long-term renal denervation (RD) on heart failure due to myocardial infarction (MI). Wistar rats were anesthetized and the bilateral renal nerves were surgically denervated 2 days before MI was induced by coronary artery ligation. Four weeks later, left ventricular (LV) function and sodium excretion were determined. In MI rats, RD improved the reduced sodium excretion. MI + RD rats revealed lower LV end-diastolic pressure and greater maximum dP/dt as compared with those of MI+ innervation (INN) rats. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions were significantly smaller and LV fractional shortening was greater in MI + RD rats than in MI + INN rats (20.9\% +/- 3.2\% vs 14.9\% +/- 3.0\%). In rats without MI, RD did not affect either sodium excretion or LV function and dimensions. The present results suggest that the long-term RD reduces LV filling pressure and improves LV function after MI, probably due to a restoration of impaired natriuresis. Increased renal sympathetic nerve activity might contribute to the progression of heart failure after MI.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Although patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are homogeneous according to the TNM staging system, they form a heterogeneous group,  which is reflected in the survival outcome. The increasing amount of information for  an individual patient and the growing number of treatment options facilitate  personalized treatment, but they also complicate treatment decision making. Decision  support systems (DSS), which provide individualized prognostic information, can  overcome this but are currently lacking. A DSS for stage III NSCLC requires the  development and integration of multiple models. The current study takes the first  step in this process by developing and validating a model that can provide  physicians with a survival probability for an individual NSCLC patient. METHODS AND  MATERIALS: Data from 548 patients with stage III NSCLC were available to enable the  development of a prediction model, using stratified Cox regression. Variables were  selected by using a bootstrap procedure. Performance of the model was expressed as  the c statistic, assessed internally and on 2 external data sets (n=174 and n=130).  RESULTS: The final multivariate model, stratified for treatment, consisted of age,  gender, World Health Organization performance status, overall treatment time,  equivalent radiation dose, number of positive lymph node stations, and gross tumor  volume. The bootstrapped c statistic was 0.62. The model could identify risk groups  in external data sets. Nomograms were constructed to predict an individual patient's  survival probability (www.predictcancer.org). The data set can be downloaded at  https://www.cancerdata.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.02.048. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction  model for overall survival of patients with stage III NSCLC highlights the  importance of combining patient, clinical, and treatment variables. Nomograms were  developed and validated. This tool could be used as a first building block for a  decision support system.},

  abstract = {Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are an important cause of maternal mortality in this environment, it accounts for about 20\% of all maternal deaths in pregnancy in Nigeria. AIM: This study aims to determine the effect of the length of sexual cohabitation on the development of hypertension in pregnancy in a Nigerian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a prospective cohort study; three centres were involved in the study between July 2006 and February 2009. For this study, the main outcome variable was the development of Hypertension in pregnancy. The main explanatory variable was the length of preconception sexual cohabitation. Univariate analysis was by t test, chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test for continuous and categorical variables. Multivariate analysis was by Cox hazard regression. RESULTS: In the study population, the incidence of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia were 28.93\% and 4.13\% respectively, 29.64\% had previous abortions and same paternity abortion rate was 25.92\%. Length of sexual cohabitation before index pregnancy was protective against hypertension in pregnancy but not for pre-eclampsia; there was a 4\% decrease in the risk of developing hypertension for every month increase in cohabitation (hazard ratio, HR 0.96 (95\% CI 0.93-0.99)). Also protective in this model was same paternity abortion with a HR of 0.71 (95\% CI 0.55-0.93). A previous abortion was not protective (HR 1.05 (95\% CI 0.82-1.35)). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that increased length of sexual cohabitation prior to conception reduces the risk of gestational hypertension.},

  abstract = {Background: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is the preferred operation for the treatment of morbid obesity by many surgeons. Hereby we present the process by which laparoscopic RYGBP (LRYGBP) developed at our institution. Methods: Perioperative morbidity was recorded from 150 consecutive morbidly obese patients operated upon by RYGBP from August 1994 to March 2002. The first 76 consecutive patients have been followed up to 5 years postoperatively. A subgroup of 40 patients was recruited to evaluate the postoperative lung function in a randomized study between receiving and not receiving prophylactic chest physiotherapy. Results: In the whole series, there were 4 conversions to open surgery, 5 leaks, 12 postoperative bleedings and 1 intestinal obstruction. 1 patient succumbed after developing acute dilatation of the bypassed stomach. Respiratory function deteriorated significantly in all patients in the early postoperative period, irrespective if given physiotherapy. During the follow-up period, 3 patients developed mechanical obstruction of the Roux limb. Another patient had a perforated ulcer at the proximal pouch. Weight reduction averaged 70\% of excess body weight at 2 years after surgery. Conclusions: LRYGBP is an effective treatment for morbid obesity. During the initial development, we experienced a number of serious complications. The complication rate decreased over time. Postoperative lung function was markedly impaired, but there were no beneficial effects of chest physiotherapy. Long-term weight loss after LRYGBP seems to be comparable to what has been reported after open RYGBP.},

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

This study was conducted to elucidate the prognostic  significance of the psoas muscle index (PMI: cross-sectional area of the bilateral  psoas muscle at the umbilical level on computed tomography/height(2) [cm(2)/m(2)])  in patients undergoing surgery for lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and lung  adenocarcinoma (ADC). METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five patients with SCC and 556  patients with ADC who underwent R0 resection between 2007 and 2014 were reviewed for  analysis. In SCC patients, the mean value (standard deviation) of the PMI was 6.15  (1.49) in men and 4.65 (1.36) in women. Among ADC patients, the PMI was 7.12 (1.60)  in men and 5.29 (1.22) in women. Clinicopathological characteristics as well as the  survival were evaluated. RESULTS: The PMI was associated with the age, body mass  index (BMI), and serum albumin. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, after  adjusting for age, BMI, serum albumin, sex, pathological stage, and diffusing  capacity for carbon monoxide, the PMI showed a significant association with the  overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in SCC patients (hazard ratios  0.50 and 0.56, 95\% confidence intervals 0.39-0.65 and 0.45-0.71, respectively). On  the other hand, in ADC patients, the PMI had no impact on the OS or DFS.  CONCLUSIONS: The PMI was significantly associated with the survival of lung SCC  patients, but not of lung ADC patients, suggesting the presence of a previously  unidentified relationship between skeletal muscle and lung SCC progression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with breast cancer who have no involved lymph nodes and estrogen-receptor-positive tumors is poorly defined by clinical and histopathological measures. METHODS: We tested whether the results of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 21 prospectively selected genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue would correlate with the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with node-negative, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer who were enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project clinical trial B-14. The levels of expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes were used in a prospectively defined algorithm to calculate a recurrence score and to determine a risk group (low, intermediate, or high) for each patient. RESULTS: Adequate RT-PCR profiles were obtained in 668 of 675 tumor blocks. The proportions of patients categorized as having a low, intermediate, or high risk by the RT-PCR assay were 51, 22, and 27 percent, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of distant recurrence at 10 years in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 6.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.6), 14.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8.3 to 20.3), and 30.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.6 to 37.4). The rate in the low-risk group was significantly lower than that in the high-risk group (P{$<$}0.001). In a multivariate Cox model, the recurrence score provided significant predictive power that was independent of age and tumor size (P{$<$}0.001). The recurrence score was also predictive of overall survival (P{$<$}0.001) and could be used as a continuous function to predict distant recurrence in individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence score has been validated as quantifying the likelihood of distant recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.},

Methods We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published from 2008 to 2016 that reported prospective observational or interventional studies of the prevalence of pre-therapeutic sarcopenia and its consequences in adults with cancer who were 18 years or older. Two independent reviewers selected articles based on titles and/or abstracts before a complete review. Sarcopenia had to be measured before cancer treatment. Methods recommended by consensuses (CT scan, MRI, dual X-ray absorptiometry or bio-impedancemetry) to assess sarcopenia were considered. Characteristics of the studies included the prevalence of pre-therapeutic sarcopenia and the prognostic value for outcomes during the cancer treatment. Results We selected 35 articles involving 6894 participants (in/out patients, clinical trials). The mean age ranged from 53 to 69.6 years. Pre-therapeutic sarcopenia was found in 38.6\% of patients [95\% CI 37.4–39.8]. Oesophageal and small-cell lung cancers showed the highest prevalence of pre-therapeutic sarcopenia. Pre-therapeutic sarcopenia was significantly and independently associated with post-operative complications, chemotherapy-induced toxicity and poor survival in cancer patients.

METHODS: We extracted patients diagnosed as NSCLC stage IIIA (cN2) between  2004 and 2011 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.  Overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) were compared among  patients given different clinical managements by Kaplan-Meier method. Other  variables such as age, sex and tumor size were analyzed to explore the factors  associated with outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 98,700 IIIA-cN2 NSCLC patients were  identified from SEER database. Survival of patients treated with surgery was better  than that of patients treated by radiotherapy alone (P{$<$}0.001). Radiation prior to  surgery significantly improved the survival in comparison with surgery alone  (P{$<$}0.001). In the subgroups of OS analysis, age {$>$}65 (P=0.902), adenocarcinoma  (P=0.279), tumor size ≤3 cm (P=0.170), well differentiated (P=0.360) patients,  preoperative radiotherapy improved survival insignificantly compared with surgery  alone. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative radiation with surgery had the most encouraging  survival outcomes in stage IIIA-cN2 NSCLC patients compared with radiation or  surgery alone. No significant outcome improvement was shown between postoperative  radiotherapy (PORT) and surgery alone.},

  abstract = {Hypertension represents a major health problem with an appalling annual toll. Despite the plethora of antihypertensive drugs, hypertension remains resistant in a considerable number of patients, thus creating the need for alternative strategies, including interventional approaches. Recently, catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation has been shown to be fairly safe and effective in patients with resistant hypertension. Pathophysiology of kidney function, interaction and crosstalk between the kidney and the brain, justifies the use of renal sympathetic denervation in the treatment of hypertension. Data from older studies have shown that sympathectomy has effectively lowered blood pressure and prolonged life expectancy of hypertensive patients, but at considerable cost. Renal sympathetic denervation is devoid of the adverse effects of surgical sympathectomy, due to its localized nature, is minimally invasive, and provides short procedural and recovery times. This paper outlines the pathophysiological background for renal sympathetic denervation, describes the past and the present of this interventional approach, and considers several future potential applications.}

  abstract = {Evidence assembled in this review indicates that sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is crucial in the development of heart failure and essential hypertension. This takes the form of persistent and adverse activation of sympathetic outflows to the heart and kidneys in both conditions. An important goal for clinical scientists is translation of the knowledge of pathophysiology, such as this, into better treatment for patients. The achievement of this 'mechanisms to management' transition is at different stages of development with regard to the two disorders. Clinical translation is mature in cardiac failure, knowledge of cardiac neural pathophysiology having led to the introduction of beta-adrenergic blockers, an effective therapy. With essential hypertension perhaps we are on the cusp of effective translation, with recent successful testing of selective catheter-based renal sympathetic nerve ablation in patients with resistant hypertension, an intervention firmly based on the demonstration of activation of the renal sympathetic outflow. Additional evidence in this regard is provided by the results of pilot studies exploring the possibility to reduce blood pressure in resistant hypertensives through electrical stimulation of the area of carotid baroreceptors. Despite the general importance of the sympathetic nervous system in blood pressure regulation, and the specific demonstration that the blood pressure elevation in essential hypertension is commonly initiated and sustained by sympathetic nervous activation, drugs antagonizing this system are currently underutilized in the care of patients with hypertension. Use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs is waning, given the propensity of this drug class to have adverse metabolic effects, including predisposition to diabetes development. The blood pressure lowering achieved with carotid baroreceptor stimulation and with the renal denervation device affirms the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension pathogenesis, and perhaps suggests a wider role for anti-adrenergic antihypertensives, such as the imidazoline drug class (moxonidine, rilmenidine) which act within the CNS to inhibit central sympathetic outflow, although the lack of large-scale outcome trials with this drug class remains a very material deficiency.}

We propose a straightforward method for doing so -- maximizing mutual information between the two, using a framework based on contrastive learning. The method encourages two elements (corresponding patches) to map to a similar point in a learned feature space, relative to other elements (other patches) in the dataset, referred to as negatives. We explore several critical design choices for making contrastive learning effective in the image synthesis setting. Notably, we use a multilayer, patch-based approach, rather than operate on entire images. Furthermore, we draw negatives from within the input image itself, rather than from the rest of the dataset. We demonstrate that our framework enables one-sided translation in the unpaired image-to-image translation setting, while improving quality and reducing training time. In addition, our method can even be extended to the training setting where each "domain" is only a single image.},

We developed a deep learning-based biomarker which noninvasively estimates a tumor immune profile with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)., Methods: A deep learning model to predict cytolytic activity score (CytAct) using semi-automatically segmented tumors on FDG-PET trained by a publicly available dataset paired with tissue RNA sequencing (n = 93). This model was validated in two independent cohorts of LUAD: SNUH (n = 43) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 16). The model was applied to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) cohort, which consists of patients with metastatic LUAD who underwent ICB treatment (n = 29)., Results: The predicted CytAct showed a positive correlation with CytAct of RNA sequencing in validation cohorts (Spearman rho = 0.32, p = 0.04 in SNUH cohort; spearman rho = 0.47, p = 0.07 in TCGA cohort). In ICB cohort, the higher predicted CytAct of individual lesion was associated with more decrement in tumor size after ICB treatment (Spearman rho = -0.54, p {$<$} 0.001). Higher minimum predicted CytAct in each patient associated with significantly prolonged progression free survival and overall survival (Hazard ratio 0.25, p = 0.001 and 0.18, p = 0.004, respectively). In patients with multiple lesions, ICB responders had significantly lower variance of predicted CytActs (p = 0.005)., Conclusion: The deep learning model that predicts CytAct using FDG-PET of LUAD was validated in independent cohorts. Our approach may be used to noninvasively assess an immune profile and predict outcomes of LUAD patients treated with ICB.},

A randomized clinical trial showed a decrease in blood pressure in resistant hypertensive patients. In order to guide clinicians and interventional practitioner for the use of this new approach, different French scientific societies (Hypertension, Cardiology and Radiology) decided to combine their expertise and propose an expert consensus to assess benefit/risk ratio of this technique in the field of arterial hypertension. In 2012, this expert consensus propose to limit renal denervation technique to patients with essential hypertension uncontrolled by four or more antihypertensive therapies with at least one treatment being a diuretic and spironolactone at a dose of 25mg shown to be unable to control blood pressure. Measurement of office BP should be at least with SBP more than 160mmHg and/or DBP more than 100mmHg confirmed by ambulatory BP measurement (home or ABP measurement with SBP more than 135mmHg and DBP more than 85mm during daytime period). Finally, renal artery anatomy and function should allow proper intervention (i.e., two functional kidneys, absence of previous renal angioplasty). Renal enervation is a complex interventional procedure with potentially arterial complications, training is required for practitioners. Antihypertensive treatment should not be interrupted immediately after renal denervation since blood pressure lowering effect are delayed and reached maximum effect after 3 months. Monitoring of blood pressure, renal function and anatomy of renal arteries is required 12 months and 36 months after procedure. The expert consensus requires the inclusion of patients experiencing this procedure in a observational study with record form and follow-up.}

  abstract = {He whose actions exceed his wisdom, his wisdom shall endure.Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa (1st century A.D.)PrefaceSo far, our analysis of causal effects has focused on primitive interventions of the form do(x), which stood for setting the value of variable X to a fixed constant, x, and asking for the effect of this action on the probabilities of some response variables Y. In this chapter we introduce several extensions of this analysis.First (Section 4.1), we discuss the status of actions vis-à-vis observations in probability theory, decision analysis, and causal modeling, and we advance the thesis that the main role of causal models is to facilitate the evaluation of the effect of novel actions and policies that were unanticipated during the construction of the model.In Section 4.2 we extend the identification analysis of Chapter 3 to conditional actions of the form “do x if you see z” and stochastic policies of the form “do x with probability p if you see z.” We shall see that the evaluation and identification of these more elaborate interventions can be obtained from the analysis of primitive interventions. In Section 4.3, we use the intervention calculus developed in Chapter 3 to give a graphical characterization of a set of semi-Markovian models for which the causal effect of one variable on another can be identified.We address in Section 4.4 the problem of evaluating the effect of sequential plans – namely, sequences of time-varying actions (some taken concurrently) designed to produce a certain outcome. We provide a graphical method of estimating the effect of such plans from nonexperimental studies in which some of the actions are influenced by observations and former actions, some observations are influenced by the actions, and some confounding variables are unmeasured. We show that there is substantial advantage to analyzing a plan into its constituent actions rather than treating the set of actions as a single entity.Finally, in Section 4.5 we address the question of distinguishing direct from indirect effects. We show that direct effects can be identified by the graphical method developed in Section 4.4. An example using alleged sex discrimination in college admission will serve to demonstrate the assumptions needed for proper analysis of direct effects.},

  abstract = {The eye obeys exactly the action of the mind.Emerson (1860)PrefaceIn the previous chapter we dealt with ways of learning causal relationships from raw data. In this chapter we explore the ways of inferring such relationships from a combination of data and qualitative causal assumptions that are deemed plausible in a given domain. More broadly, this chapter aims to help researchers communicate qualitative assumptions about cause–effect relationships, elucidate the ramifications of such assumptions, and derive causal inferences from a combination of assumptions, experiments, and data. Our major task will be to decide whether the assumptions given are sufficient for assessing the strength of causal effects from nonexperimental data.Causal effects permit us to predict how systems would respond to hypothetical interventions – for example, policy decisions or actions performed in everyday activity. As we have seen in Chapter 1 (Section 1.3), such predictions are the hallmark of the empirical sciences and are not discernible from probabilistic information alone; they rest on – and, in fact, define – causal relationships. This chapter uses causal diagrams to give formal semantics to the notion of intervention, and it provides explicit formulas for postintervention probabilities in terms of preintervention probabilities. The implication is that the effects of every intervention can be estimated from nonexperimental data, provided the data is supplemented with a causal diagram that is both acyclic and contains no latent variables.},

  abstract = {This review presents empirical researchers with recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

  abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.},

The completeness proofs of [Huang and Valtorta, 2006] and [Shpitser and Pearl, 2006] and the graphical criteria of [Tian and Shpitser, 2010] have laid this identification problem to rest. Recent explorations unveil the usefulness of the do-calculus in three additional areas : mediation analysis [Pearl, 2012], transportability [Pearl and Bareinboim, 2011] and meta-synthesis. Meta-synthesis (freshly coined) is the task of fusing empirical results from several diverse studies, conducted on heterogeneous populations and under different conditions, so as to synthesize an estimate of a causal relation in some target environment, potentially different from those under study. The talk surveys these results with emphasis on the challenges posed by meta-synthesis. For background material, see (http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/csl\_papers.html).},

  abstract = {Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them.Pascal (1670)INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY THEORYWhy Probabilities?Causality connotes lawlike necessity, whereas probabilities connote exceptionality, doubt, and lack of regularity. Still, there are two compelling reasons for starting with, and in fact stressing, probabilistic analysis of causality; one is fairly straightforward, the other more subtle.The simple reason rests on the observation that causal utterances are often used in situations that are plagued with uncertainty. We say, for example, “reckless driving causes accidents” or “you will fail the course because of your laziness” (Suppes 1970), knowing quite well that the antecedents merely tend to make the consequences more likely, not absolutely certain. Any theory of causality that aims at accommodating such utterances must therefore be cast in a language that distinguishes various shades of likelihood – namely, the language of probabilities. Connected with this observation, we note that probability theory is currently the official mathematical language of most disciplines that use causal modeling, including economics, epidemiology, sociology, and psychology. In these disciplines, investigators are concerned not merely with the presence or absence of causal connections but also with the relative strengths of those connections and with ways of inferring those connections from noisy observations. Probability theory, aided by methods of statistical analysis, provides both the principles and the means of coping with – and drawing inferences from – such observations.},

  abstract = {And the Lord said,“If I find in the city of Sodom fifty good men,I will pardon the whole place for their sake.”Genesis 18:26PrefaceThis chapter provides a formal analysis of structure-based counterfactuals, a concept introduced briefly in Chapters 1 and 3 that will occupy the rest of our discussion in this book. Through this analysis, we will obtain sharper mathematical definitions of other concepts that were introduced in earlier chapters, including causal models, action, causal effects, causal relevance, error terms, and exogeneity.After casting the concepts of causal model and counterfactuals in formal mathematical terms, we will demonstrate by examples how counterfactual questions can be answered from both deterministic and probabilistic causal models (Section 7.1). In Section 7.2.1, we will argue that policy analysis is an exercise in counterfactual reasoning and demonstrate this thesis in a simple example taken from econometrics. This will set the stage for our discussion in Section 7.2.2, where we explicate the empirical content of counterfactuals in terms of policy predictions. Section 7.2.3 discusses the role of counterfactuals in the interpretation and generation of causal explanations. Section 7.2 concludes with discussions of how causal relationships emerge from actions and mechanisms (Section 7.2.4) and how causal directionality can be induced from a set of symmetric equations (Section 7.2.5).In Section 7.3 we develop an axiomatic characterization of counterfactual and causal relevance relationships as they emerge from the structural model semantics. Section 7.3.1 will identify a set of properties, or axioms, that allow us to derive new counterfactual relations from assumptions, and Section 7.3.2 demonstrates the use of these axioms in algebraic derivation of causal effects. Section 7.3.3 introduces axioms for the relationship of causal relevance and, using their similarity to the axioms of graphs, describes the use of graphs for verifying relevance relationships.The axiomatic characterization developed in Section 7.3 enables us to compare structural models with other approaches to causality and counterfactuals, most notably those based on Lewis's closest-world semantics (Sections 7.4.1–7.4.4). The formal equivalence of the structural approach and the Neyman–Rubin potential-outcome framework is discussed in Section 7.4.4. Finally, we revisit the topic of exogeneity and extend our discussion of Section 5.4.3 with counterfactual definitions of exogenous and instrumental variables in Section 7.4.5.},

Recent publications in the areas of diverticulosis and diverticular disease have highlighted several notable advances that are now changing practice. Despite colonic diverticula being common, only 1–4 \% of individuals with colonic diverticula will develop diverticulitis. After a first occurrence of acute diverticulitis, the risk of recurrence is 20 \% at 5 years. Complications most commonly occur with the first occurrence of acute diverticulitis and not with recurrent episodes. After an episode of diverticulitis, many patients continue to experience chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Prophylactic surgery is an option to reduce the risk of recurrence and its negative impact on quality of life. Importantly, the rationale for surgery is no longer to prevent complications because this risk is low. The review concludes with practical recommendations for patients with diverticulosis and diverticular disease.},

  abstract = {Painful peripheral neuropathies have been associated with a reorganization of skin innervation. However, the detailed changes in skin innervation by the different afferent fiber types following a neuropathic nerve injury have never been characterized in an animal model of neuropathic pain. Our objective was to thoroughly characterize such changes in the thick skin of the foot in a well-established rat model of neuropathic pain, namely, the chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. We used the immunofluorescence detection of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), purinergic receptor P2X3, and NF200 as markers of peptidergic nociceptive fibers, nonpeptidergic nociceptive C fibers, and myelinated afferents, respectively. We observed that CCI-operated animals developed significant mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia as well as thermal hyperalgesia. At 3 days following nerve injury, all CCI-operated animals had a significant decrease in the density of fibers immunoreactive (IR) for CGRP, P2X3, and NF200 within the upper dermis. A recovery of CGRP-IR fibers occurred within 4 weeks of nerve injury and sprouting above control levels was observed at 16 weeks. However, the myelinated (NF200-IR) fibers never recovered to control levels within a period of 16 weeks following nerve injury. Interestingly, the P2X3-IR fibers took considerably more time to recover than the CGRP-IR fibers following the initial loss. A loss in P2X3-IR fibers persisted to 16 weeks and recovered to levels above that of control at 1.5 years following nerve injury. Further studies are required to clarify the relevance of these innervation changes for neuropathic pain generation and maintenance.},

Performativity is a well-studied phenomenon in policy-making that has so far been neglected in supervised learning. When ignored, performativity surfaces as undesirable distribution shift, routinely addressed with retraining. We develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual novelty is an equilibrium notion we call performative stability. Performative stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal loss. In full generality, performative prediction strictly subsumes the setting known as strategic classification. We thus also give the first sufficient conditions for retraining to overcome strategic feedback effects.},

Among US adults with hypertension, 8.9\% (SE: 0.6\%) met criteria for resistant hypertension. This represented 12.8\% (SE: 0.9\%) of the antihypertensive drug-treated population. Of all drug-treated adults whose hypertension was uncontrolled, 72.4\% (SE: 1.6\%) were taking drugs from {$<$}3 classes. Compared with those with controlled hypertension using 1 to 3 medication classes, adults with resistant hypertension were more likely to be older, to be non-Hispanic black, and to have higher body mass index (all P{$<$}0.001). They were more likely to have albuminuria, reduced renal function, and self-reported medical histories of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and diabetes mellitus (P{$<$}0.001). Most (85.6\% [SE: 2.4\%]) individuals with resistant hypertension used a diuretic. Of this group, 64.4\% (SE: 3.2\%) used the relatively weak thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Although not rare, resistant hypertension is currently found in only a modest proportion of the hypertensive population. Among those classified here as resistant, inadequate diuretic therapy may be a modifiable therapeutic target. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and renal dysfunction were all common in this population.},

We studied the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) nerve-mediated relaxation induced by electrical stimulation in pig isolated lower urinary tract smooth muscle, and the possible involvement of the L-arginine (L-ARG)/nitric oxide (NO) pathway in this response. 2. Trigonal strips, precontracted by noradrenaline (NA), carbachol or endothelin-1 (ET-1), relaxed frequency-dependently in response to electrical stimulation. Maximum relaxation was obtained at 6-8 Hz, and amounted to 56 +/- 2\%, 77 +/- 3\% and 62 +/- 6\% of the agonist-induced tension in preparations contracted by NA, carbachol, or ET-1, respectively. Exposure to NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG; 10(-7)-10(-5) M) concentration-dependently reduced the relaxant response in preparations contracted by NA. L-NOARG (10(-6) M) reduced the maximal response to 51 +/- 8\% of control. L-NOARG (10(-5) M) abolished all relaxation, and unmasked a contractile component; D-NOARG had no effect. Also in trigonal preparations, where the tension had been raised by carbachol or ET-1, L-NOARG (10(-5) M) markedly reduced relaxations evoked by electrical stimulation. 3. In trigonal preparations contracted by NA, maximal relaxation was increased after pretreatment with L-ARG (10(-3) M), and the inhibitory effect of L-NOARG (10(-6) M) was prevented. Incubation of the trigonal strips with methylene blue had no effect on relaxations elicited at frequencies less than 6 Hz, but a small inhibition was observed at higher frequencies. 4. Administration of NO (present in acidified solution of NaNO2) induced concentration-dependent relaxations in trigonal preparations contracted by NA, carbachol, or ET-1.L-NOARG (10-5 M) and L-ARG (10-3M) had no effect on these relaxations. However, methylene blue (10-S M) significantly shifted the concentration-response curve for NO to the right. NANC-relaxation and NO-induced relaxation of trigonal preparations were both inhibited by oxyhaemoglobin (10-5 M) and pyrogallol (10-4 M).5. In urethral preparations precontracted by NA, electrical stimulation caused frequency-dependent relaxations. A maximum relaxation of 73 +/- 4\% was obtained at 10 Hz. Also in the urethra, NANCrelaxation was blocked by L-NOARG (10-5 M), and a contractile response generally appeared.6. Detrusor strips treated with alpha-beta methylene ATP (10-i M) and atropine (10-6 M), and then contracted by ET-1, showed relaxations (19 +/- 3\% of the induced tension) in response to electrical field stimulation (2-20 Hz) only when the tension was high. No response at all, or small contractions, were found in response to electrical stimulation in K+ (35 mM)-contracted detrusor strips. Detrusor preparations contracted by carbachol were concentration-dependently relaxed by exogenously administered NO, SIN-1 (NO-donor), and isoprenaline, whereas vasoactive intestinal polypeptide had minor effects. NO and SIN-1 induced maximal relaxations of 63 +/- 3\% and 70 +/- 4\%, respectively, of the tension induced by carbachol. Isoprenaline produced an almost complete relaxation (96 +/- 4\%).7. The results suggest that NANC-nerve mediated relaxation, involving the L-ARG/NO pathway, can be demonstrated consistently in the pig trigonal and urethral, but not in detrusor smooth muscle. The importance of this pathway for lower urinary tract physiology and pathophysiology remains to be established.},

  abstract = {Based on the SYMPLICITY studies and CE (Conformit\&\#xE9; Europ\&\#xE9;enne) certification, renal denervation is currently applied as a novel treatment of resistant hypertension in Europe. However, information on the proportion of patients with resistant hypertension qualifying for renal denervation after a thorough work-up and treatment adjustment remains scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the proportion of patients eligible for renal denervation and the reasons for noneligibility at 11 expert centers participating in the European Network COordinating Research on renal Denervation in treatment-resistant hypertension (ENCOReD). The analysis included 731 patients. Age averaged 61.6 years, office blood pressure at screening was 177/96 mm Hg, and the number of blood pressure-lowering drugs taken was 4.1. Specialists referred 75.6\% of patients. The proportion of patients eligible for renal denervation according to the SYMPLICITY HTN-2 criteria and each center's criteria was 42.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 38.0\%-47.0\%) and 39.7\% (36.2\%-43.2\%), respectively. The main reasons of noneligibility were normalization of blood pressure after treatment adjustment (46.9\%), unsuitable renal arterial anatomy (17.0\%), and previously undetected secondary causes of hypertension (11.1\%). In conclusion, after careful screening and treatment adjustment at hypertension expert centers, only \&\#x2248;40\% of patients referred for renal denervation, mostly by specialists, were eligible for the procedure. The most frequent cause of ineligibility (approximately half of cases) was blood pressure normalization after treatment adjustment by a hypertension specialist. Our findings highlight that hypertension centers with a record in clinical experience and research should remain the gatekeepers before renal denervation is considered.}

However, the impressive fall in blood pressure reported after RDN in Symplicity HTN-2, the first randomised study, and multiple observational studies has not been confirmed in the US sham-controlled trial Symplicity HTN-3 and four subsequent prospective randomised studies, all published or presented in 2014. The blood pressure reduction documented in earlier studies may be largely due to non-specific effects such as improvement of drug adherence in initially poorly adherent patients (Hawthorne effect), placebo effect and regression to the mean. The overall blood pressure lowering effect of RDN seems rather limited and the characteristics of true responders remain largely unknown. Accordingly, RDN is not ready for clinical practice. In most patients with apparent drug-resistant hypertension, drug monitoring and subsequent improvement of drug adherence may prove more effective and cost-beneficial to achieve blood pressure control. In the meantime, research should aim at identifying characteristics of those few patients adherent to drug treatment and with true resistant hypertension who may respond to RDN.},

The mathematization of causality is a relatively recent development, and has become increasingly important in data science and machine learning. This book offers a self-contained and concise introduction to causal models and how to learn them from data. After explaining the need for causal models and discussing some of the principles underlying causal inference, the book teaches readers how to use causal models: how to compute intervention distributions, how to infer causal models from observational and interventional data, and how causal ideas could be exploited for classical machine learning problems. All of these topics are discussed first in terms of two variables and then in the more general multivariate case. The bivariate case turns out to be a particularly hard problem for causal learning because there are no conditional independences as used by classical methods for solving multivariate cases. The authors consider analyzing statistical asymmetries between cause and effect to be highly instructive, and they report on their decade of intensive research into this problem. The book is accessible to readers with a background in machine learning or statistics, and can be used in graduate courses or as a reference for researchers. The text includes code snippets that can be copied and pasted, exercises, and an appendix with a summary of the most important technical concepts.},

Renal injury and ischemia, activation of renin angiotensin system and dysfunction of nitric oxide system have been implicated in adrenergic activation from kidney. Conversely, several lines of evidence suggest that sympathetic overactivity, through functional and morphological alterations in renal physiology and structure, may contribute to kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression. Pharmacologic modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity has been found to have a blood pressure independent renoprotective effect. The inadequate normalization of sympathoexcitation by pharmacologic treatment asks for novel treatment options. Catheter based renal denervation targets selectively both efferent and afferent renal nerves and functionally denervates the kidney providing blood pressure reduction in clinical trials and renoprotection in experimental models by ameliorating the effects of excessive renal sympathetic drive. This review will focus on the role of sympathetic overactivity in the pathogenesis of kidney injury and CKD progression and will speculate on the effect of renal denervation to these conditions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Commonly reported complications after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) include febrile  neutropenia, radiation esophagitis, and pneumonitis. We studied the incidence of  tumor cavitation and/or "tumor abscess" after CCRT in a single-institutional cohort.  METHODS: Between 2003 and 2010, 87 patients with stage III NSCLC underwent  cisplatin-based CCRT and all subsequent follow-up at the VU University Medical  Center. Diagnostic and radiotherapy planning computed tomography scans were reviewed  for tumor cavitation, which was defined as a nonbronchial air-containing cavity  located within the primary tumor. Pulmonary toxicities scored as Common Toxicity  Criteria v3.0 of grade III or more, occurring within 90 days after end of  radiotherapy, were analyzed. RESULTS: In the entire cohort, tumor cavitation was  observed on computed tomography scans of 16 patients (18\%). The histology in  cavitated tumors was squamous cell (n = 14), large cell (n = 1), or adenocarcinoma  (n = 1). Twenty patients (23\%) experienced pulmonary toxicity of grade III or more,  other than radiation pneumonitis. Eight patients with a tumor cavitation (seven  squamous cell carcinoma) developed severe pulmonary complications; tumor abscess (n  = 5), fatal hemorrhage (n = 2), and fatal embolism (n = 1). Two patients with a  tumor abscess required open-window thoracostomy post-CCRT. The median overall  survival for patients with or without tumor cavitation were 9.9 and 16.3 months,  respectively (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: With CCRT, acute pulmonary toxicity of grade  III or more developed in 50\% of patients with stage III NSCLC, who also had  radiological features of tumor cavitation. The optimal treatment of patients with  this presentation is unclear given the high risk of a tumor abscess.},

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are used to model a priori causal assumptions and inform variable selection strategies for causal questions. Although tools originally designed for prediction are finding applications in causal inference, the counterpart has remained largely unexplored. The aim of this theoretical and simulation-based study is to assess the potential benefit of using DAGs in clinical risk prediction modeling.                                         Methods               We explore how incorporating knowledge about the underlying causal structure can provide insights about the transportability of diagnostic clinical risk prediction models to different settings. We further probe whether causal knowledge can be used to improve predictor selection in clinical risk prediction models.                                         Results               A single-predictor model in the causal direction is likely to have better transportability than one in the anticausal direction in some scenarios. We empirically show that the Markov Blanket, the set of variables including the parents, children, and parents of the children of the outcome node in a DAG, is the optimal set of predictors for that outcome.                                         Conclusions               Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the intuition that a diagnostic clinical risk prediction model including causes as predictors is likely to be more transportable. Furthermore, using DAGs to identify Markov Blanket variables may be a useful, efficient strategy to select predictors in clinical risk prediction models if strong knowledge of the underlying causal structure exists or can be learned.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Currently, there are no robust biomarkers that predict immunotherapy outcomes in metastatic melanoma. We sought to build multivariable predictive models for response and survival to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) monotherapy or in combination with anticytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 (ipilimumab [IPI]; anti-PD-1 ± IPI) by including routine clinical data available at the point of treatment initiation. METHODS: One thousand six hundred forty-four patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 ± IPI at 16 centers from Australia, the United States, and Europe were included. Demographics, disease characteristics, and baseline blood parameters were analyzed. The end points of this study were objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The final predictive models for ORR, PFS, and OS were determined through penalized regression methodology (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method) to select the most significant predictors for all three outcomes (discovery cohort, N = 633). Each model was validated internally and externally in two independent cohorts (validation-1 [N = 419] and validation-2 [N = 592]) and nomograms were created. RESULTS: The final model for predicting ORR (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.71) in immunotherapy-treated patients included the following clinical parameters: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, presence/absence of liver and lung metastases, serum lactate dehydrogenase, blood neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, therapy (monotherapy/combination), and line of treatment. The final predictive models for PFS (AUC = 0.68) and OS (AUC = 0.77) included the same variables as those in the ORR model (except for presence/absence of lung metastases), and included presence/absence of brain metastases and blood hemoglobin. Nomogram calculators were developed from the clinical models to predict outcomes for patients with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 ± IPI. CONCLUSION: Newly developed combinations of routinely collected baseline clinical factors predict the response and survival outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with immunotherapy and may serve as valuable tools for clinical decision making.},

The objectives of this study were to examine the patterns of response and survival in patients treated with combination ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 therapy (IPI~+~PD1) and to explore the nature of pseudoprogression and acquired resistance. METHODS: Patients with metastatic melanoma who received treatment with first-line IPI~+~PD1 had all metastases ≥5~mm measured on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging studies. The lesional response rate (LRR) and the overall response rate (ORR) were determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. RESULTS: In total, 140 patients who had 833 metastases were studied. The ORR and the overall complete response (CR) rate decreased as tumor burden or the number of metastases increased. Metastases that had a CR (49\%) were smaller than metastases without a CR (median, 13 vs 17~mm; P~{$<~$}.0001). Soft-tissue and lung metastases had the highest LRR (79\% and 77\%, respectively), whereas liver metastases had the lowest (46\%). In multivariate analysis, patients with lung metastases had superior ORR (odds ratio [OR], 2.75; P~=~.02) and progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; P~=~.02), whereas those with liver metastases had inferior ORR (OR, 0.33; P~=~.02), progression-free survival (HR, 4.03; P~{$<~$}.01), and overall survival (HR, 3.17; P~=~.01). Pseudoprogression occurred in one-third of patients who had progressive disease as their best response, with an overall survival that was comparable to that of patients without disease progression. Acquired resistance occurred in 12\% of responders after a median of 9.6~months, with an overall survival rate of 83\% at 1~year from progression. CONCLUSIONS: Metastases in different anatomical locations display distinct response patterns and also are associated with overall response and survival with combination immunotherapy. Specific sites of disease may hold unique mechanisms of resistance and should allow for more personalized treatment.},

  abstract = {Systemic hypertension represents a significant global concern, because it contributes to vascular and renal morbidity, cardiovascular mortality, and economic burden, hence the impact of hypertension is a major issue in public health worldwide. Improving high blood pressure management is therefore fundamental to influencing clinical outcomes. Despite adherence to multiple available medical therapies, a significant proportion of patients has persistent blood pressure elevation, a condition termed "resistant hypertension". Renal sympathetic innervations contribute to lack of response of anti-hypertensive drugs through an imbalance of regulatory mechanisms. Renal afferent nerve fibers are responsible for sympathetic activation and contribute to blood pressure homeostasis while afferent signals from the kidneys are integrated at the central nervous system and enhance sympathetic nerve discharge. In this regard, a novel strategy that selectively removes these hypertensive contributors represents a new therapeutic opportunity. Recently, a catheter-based method to induce renal sympathetic denervation has been introduced into daily practice. Clinical evaluation of selective renal sympathetic denervation demonstrated a decrease of renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, an increase of renal plasma flow, and has confirmed clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. This review summarizes the available data on the role of sympathetic activation in the pathophysiology of hypertension and the current concepts in transcatheter renal artery ablation with radiofrequency delivery for systemic hypertension. Suggestions regarding targets for future systemic hypertension management are also described.}

  abstract = {Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common and highly lethal disease. As advanced treatment modalities are being developed, improved prognostication methods are sought. L3 skeletal muscle index (L3SMI) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels are accepted surrogate markers of sarcopenia and related frailty. We aimed to evaluate the potential association of these markers with NSCLC patients’ survival. Methods: A retrospective, single-center study of an NSCLC patients’ cohort. L3SMI was calculated based on skeletal muscle area on computed tomography scans at the level of the L3 vertebra. Clinical data were extracted from clinical charts. Results: A total of 140 patients (56.4\% males,median age 66 [range 37-86])were included in this study, 32\% were diagnosed at stage 3 and 45\% at stage 4.During the follow-up duration (median of 1.9 years; range 1 month to 6.4 years), 102 patients (72.8\%) died. Patients’ characteristics that were found to be associated with increased mortality were performance status, albumin and tumor stage at diagnosis. Sarcopenia, defined as low L3SMI (lower than 41 cm2/m2 for women and lower than 53 cm2/m2 for men) was significantly associated with higher risk of mortality compared with patients with normal L3SMI values (77.2\%, vs 64.6\%, p=0.013) in univariate analysis, but not in a multiple regression analysis. Conclusion: Low L3SMI could serve as a surrogate marker for sarcopenia and frailty and, as such, facilitate the prognostication process of NSCLC patients. © 2019 Portal et al.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of body composition (BC) variability in contemporary populations has significantly increased with the use of imaging techniques. Abnormal BC such as sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and obesity (excess adipose tissue) are predictors of poorer prognosis in a variety of conditions or clinical situations. As a catabolic illness, a defining feature of cancer is muscle loss. Although the conceptual model of wasting in cancer is typically conceived as involuntary weight loss leading to low body weight, recent studies have shown that both sarcopenia and cachexia can be present with obesity. The combination of low muscle and high adipose tissue (sarcopenic obesity) is an emerging abnormal BC phenotype prevalent across the body weight, and hence BMI spectra. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in cancer are in most instances occult conditions, which have been independently associated with higher incidence of chemotherapy toxicity, shorter time to tumour progression, poorer outcomes of surgery, physical impairment and shorter survival. Although the mechanisms are yet to be fully understood, the associations with poorer clinical outcomes emphasise the value of nutritional assessment as well as the need to develop appropriate interventions to countermeasure abnormal BC. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity create diverse nutritional requirements, highlighting the compelling need for a more comprehensive and differentiated understanding of energy and protein requirements in this heterogeneous population.}

  abstract = {Malignant neoplasms are heterogeneous for many different biological characteristics, including invasion and metastasis. The pathogenesis of metastasis involves a series of sequential steps which must be completed by metastatic cells. In the present study we examined the metastatic behavior of three highly metastatic and three nonmetastatic subpopulations isolated from the K-1735 melanoma syngeneic to the C3H/HeN mouse. Cells were labeled with [125I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, and their initial organ distribution, fate, and production of experimental metastases were determined. Highly metastatic cells survived in lung parenchyma to produce metastases, whereas nonmetastatic cells did not. However, even with the highly metastatic cells only 2\% of the original inoculum was responsible for the final production of metastases. The results support the concept that the fate of tumor cells released into the bloodstream is determined by sequential and selective events and introduces a third regulatory factor. Cells endowed with metastatic properties have a higher probability of forming metastases than cells not so endowed, but this probability is not 100\%. Hence, metastasis should be considered as a sequential, selective, and stochastic process.},

  abstract = {Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has boosted the appearance of clinical predictions models in medical literature. Many of these models aim to provide guidance for decision making on treatment initiation. Special consideration on how to account for post-baseline treatments is needed when developing such models. We examined how post-baseline treatment was handled in published Covid-19 clinical prediction models and we illustrated how much estimated risks may differ according to how treatment is handled. Methods: Firstly, we reviewed 33 Covid-19 prognostic models published in literature in the period up to 5 May 2020. We extracted: 1) the reported intended use of the model; 2) how treatment was incorporated during model development and 3) whether the chosen analysis strategy was in agreement with the intended use. Secondly, we used nationwide Dutch data on hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 to illustrate how estimated mortality risks will differ when using four different analysis strategies to model ICU treatment. Results: Of the 33 papers, 21 (64\%) had misalignment between intended use and analysis strategy, 7 (21\%) were unclear about the estimated risk and only 5 (15\%) had clear alignment between intended use and analysis strategy. We showed with real data how different approaches to post-baseline treatment yield different estimated mortality risks, ranging between 33\% and 46\% for a 75 year-old patient with two medical conditions. Conclusions: Misalignment between intended use and analysis strategy is common in reported Covid-19 clinical prediction models. This can lead to considerable under or overestimation of intended risks.},

  abstract = {Big data, high-performance computing, and (deep) machine learning are increasingly becoming key to precision medicine—from identifying disease risks and taking preventive measures, to making diagnoses and personalizing treatment for individuals. Precision medicine, however, is not only about predicting risks and outcomes, but also about weighing interventions. Interventional clinical predictive models require the correct specification of cause and effect, and the calculation of so-called counterfactuals, that is, alternative scenarios. In biomedical research, observational studies are commonly affected by confounding and selection bias. Without robust assumptions, often requiring a priori domain knowledge, causal inference is not feasible. Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Therefore, the premise that data-driven prediction models lead to trustable decisions/interventions for precision medicine is questionable. When pursuing intervention modelling, the bio-health informatics community needs to employ causal approaches and learn causal structures. Here we discuss how target trials (algorithmic emulation of randomized studies), transportability (the licence to transfer causal effects from one population to another) and prediction invariance (where a true causal model is contained in the set of all prediction models whose accuracy does not vary across different settings) are linchpins to developing and testing intervention models.},

  abstract = {Causal effect estimation relies on separating the variation in the outcome into parts due to the treatment and due to the confounders. To achieve this separation, practitioners often use external sources of randomness that only influence the treatment called instrumental variables (IVs). We study variables constructed from treatment and IV that help estimate effects, called control functions. We characterize general control functions for effect estimation in a meta-identification result. Then, we show that structural assumptions on the treatment process allow the construction of general control functions, thereby guaranteeing identification. To construct general control functions and estimate effects, we develop the general control function method (GCFN). GCFN's first stage called variational decoupling (VDE) constructs general control functions by recovering the residual variation in the treatment given the IV. Using VDE's control function, GCFN's second stage estimates effects via regression. Further, we develop semi-supervised GCFN to construct general control functions using subsets of data that have both IV and confounders observed as supervision; this needs no structural treatment process assumptions. We evaluate GCFN on low and high dimensional simulated data and on recovering the causal effect of slave export on modern community trust.},

This retrospective study evaluated the oncological  outcomes of CT-guided MWA in patients with large NSCLC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was  used to evaluate overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The  log-rank test was used to compare survival between patients with an NSCLC size  greater or smaller than 4 cm. The likelihood of local tumor progression (LTP) was  analyzed using a multivariable regression model. A total of 53 patients with 65  tumors were analyzed. The mean tumor size was 5.0±1.8 cm. At the 1-month CT scan,  complete tumor ablation was observed in 44.6\% of cases. In 18.5\% of cases a redo-MWA  session was carried out, while in 4.6\%, a third MWA was necessary to obtain complete  tumor necrosis. The mean follow-up was 28.1±20.6 months with a median duration of  21.5 months. The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year OS rates were 78.2, 48.3, 34.8  and 18.3\%, respectively. The median CSS was 25 months (95\% CI 15.5-34.5). The  1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year CSS rates were 84.3, 53.7, 42.1 and 30.0\%,  respectively. OS in patients with tumor size ≥4 cm was significantly lower when  compared with those having smaller tumors (P=0.03). LTP was observed in 19 patients  (35.8\%). Incomplete tumor ablation [odds ratio (OR) 6.57; P{$<$}0.05] and tumor size ≥4  cm (OR 0.18; P{$<$}0.05) were significant independent predictors of LTP. In conclusion,  CT-guided MWA may represent a useful tool in the multimodality treatment of patients  with large advanced NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The effects of chronic hypotension on the density and intensity of fluorescence (after treatment with glyoxylic acid) of the plexus of adrenergic fibers in the wall of the saphenous artery and on the reinnervation of this vessel were studied in Wistar rats. Regional hypotension in the vascular bed of the hind part of the rats’ bodies was induced by stenosis of the abdominal part of the aorta distal to the renal arteries. After four weeks, the saphenous artery was denervated in one limb by resection of a segment of the femoral nerve. In the limb with the nerve lesion, chronic (6–7 weeks) hypotension led to a reduction in the intensity of nerve fiber fluorescence by 20\% as compared with normotensive animals (controls), though the density of the nerve plexus did not change. Partial reinnervation of the vessel was observed 2–3 weeks after femoral nerve lesioning. Measures of reinnervation in normotensive and hypotensive rats were no different at two weeks, though at three weeks rats with hypotension showed more complete recovery of innervation.},

  abstract = {Recently, multiple imputation has been proposed as a tool for individual patient data meta-analysis with sporadically missing observations, and it has been suggested that within-study imputation is usually preferable. However, such within study imputation cannot handle variables that are completely missing within studies. Further, if some of the contributing studies are relatively small, it may be appropriate to share information across studies when imputing. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a joint modelling approach to multiple imputation of individual patient data in meta-analysis, with an across-study probability distribution for the study specific covariance matrices. This retains the flexibility to allow for between-study heterogeneity when imputing while allowing (i) sharing information on the covariance matrix across studies when this is appropriate, and (ii) imputing variables that are wholly missing from studies. Simulation results show both equivalent performance to the within-study imputation approach where this is valid, and good results in more general, practically relevant, scenarios with studies of very different sizes, non-negligible between-study heterogeneity and wholly missing variables. We illustrate our approach using data from an individual patient data meta-analysis of hypertension trials. ©~2015 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Our approach leverages CEVSM to efficiently produce reliable ECG samples, facilitating data augmentation essential for the computer-aided diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Significantly, experimental results show that our model dramatically reduces computation time compared to conventional models, with the self-adapting regression transformation matrix method (SRTM) providing clear advantages. SRTM not only achieves high fidelity in ECG simulations but also ensures exceptional consistency with the gold standard method, greatly enhancing MI localization accuracy by data augmentation. These advancements highlight the potential of our model to generate dependable ECG training samples, making it highly suitable for data augmentation and significantly advancing the development and validation of intelligent MI diagnostic systems. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the feasibility of applying life system simulations in the training of medical big models.},

  abstract = {Clinicians handle a growing amount of clinical, biometric, and biomarker data. In this “big data” era, there is an emerging faith that the answer to all clinical and scientific questions reside in “big data” and that data will transform medicine into precision medicine. However, data by themselves are useless. It is the algorithms encoding causal reasoning and domain (e.g., clinical and biological) knowledge that prove transformative. The recent introduction of (health) data science presents an opportunity to re-think this data-centric view. For example, while precision medicine seeks to provide the right prevention and treatment strategy to the right patients at the right time, its realization cannot be achieved by algorithms that operate exclusively in data-driven prediction modes, as do most machine learning algorithms. Better understanding of data science and its tasks is vital to interpret findings and translate new discoveries into clinical practice. In this review, we first discuss the principles and major tasks of data science by organizing it into three defining tasks: 1) association and prediction, 2) intervention, and 3) counterfactual causal inference. Second, we review commonly-used data science tools with examples in the medical literature. Lastly, we outline current challenges and future directions in the fields of medicine, elaborating on how data science can enhance clinical effectiveness and inform medical practice. As machine learning algorithms become ubiquitous tools to handle quantitatively “big data”, their integration with causal reasoning and domain knowledge is instrumental to qualitatively transform medicine, which will, in turn, improve health outcomes of patients.},

  abstract = {Background Patients who are surgically treated for stage I to III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have dismal prognosis after incomplete (R1-R2) resection. Our study aimed to develop a prediction model to estimate the chance of incomplete resection based on preoperative patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors. Methods From a Dutch national cancer database, NSCLC patients who had surgical treatment without neoadjuvant therapy were selected. Thirteen possible predictors were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to create a prediction model. External validation was applied in the American National Cancer Database, whereupon the model was adjusted. Discriminatory ability and calibration of the model was determined after internal and external validation. The prediction model was presented as nomogram. Results Of 7156 patients, 511 had an incomplete resection (7.1\%). Independent predictors were histology, cT stage, cN stage, extent of surgery, and open vs thoracoscopic approach. After internal validation, the corrected C statistic of the resulting nomogram was 0.72. Application of the nomogram to an external data set of 85,235 patients with incomplete resection in 2485 patients (2.9\%) resulted in a C statistic of 0.71. Calibration revealed good overall fit of the nomogram in both cohorts. Conclusions An internationally validated nomogram is presented providing the ability to predict the individual chance of incomplete resection in patients with stage I to III NSCLC planned for resection. In case of a high predicted risk of incomplete resection, alternative treatment strategies could be considered, whereas a low risk further supports the use of surgical procedures.},

  abstract = {Importance~ Diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon is an increasingly common disease. Patterns of care and management guidelines have significantly evolved in recent years.Objectives To review and classify the primary data published since 2000 that are guiding decision making, technical considerations, and the outcomes of surgery for sigmoid diverticulitis.Evidence Review We searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for studies pertaining to the diagnosis and management of chronic and recurrent diverticulitis from January 1, 2000, to March 31, 2013. We supplemented this automated search with references drawn from included studies and PubMed. We rated the level of evidence according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.Findings We identified 68 studies meeting inclusion criteria for final review. The studies were almost exclusively observational and had limited certainty of treatment effect. We found that complicated recurrence after recovery from an uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis is rare ({$<$}5\%) and that age at onset younger than 50 years and 2 or more recurrences do not increase the risk of complications. Chronic symptoms may persist even after resection in 5\% to 22\% of patients. Prophylactic surgery is generally not recommended for average-risk patients with diverticulitis, irrespective of the number of episodes of acute, noncomplicated disease. Decisions to proceed with colon resection should be based instead on the patient-reported frequency and severity of diverticulitis symptoms.Conclusions and Relevance The prior standard for proceeding with elective colectomy following 2 episodes of diverticulitis is no longer accepted. Decisions to proceed with colectomy should be made based on consideration of the risks of recurrent diverticulitis, the morbidity of surgery, ongoing symptoms, the complexity of disease, and operative risk. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred to open approaches. Recent evidence suggests that existing guidelines should be updated.},

  abstract = {Activation of renal sympathetic nerves is key to pathogenesis of essential hypertension. We aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of catheter-based renal denervation for reduction of blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. In this multicentre, prospective, randomised trial, patients who had a baseline systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more (≥150 mm Hg for patients with type 2 diabetes), despite taking three or more antihypertensive drugs, were randomly allocated in a one-to-one ratio to undergo renal denervation with previous treatment or to maintain previous treatment alone (control group) at 24 participating centres. Randomisation was done with sealed envelopes. Data analysers were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness endpoint was change in seated office-based measurement of systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Primary analysis included all patients remaining in follow-up at 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00888433. 106 (56\%) of 190 patients screened for eligibility were randomly allocated to renal denervation (n=52) or control (n=54) groups between June 9, 2009, and Jan 15, 2010. 49 (94\%) of 52 patients who underwent renal denervation and 51 (94\%) of 54 controls were assessed for the primary endpoint at 6 months. Office-based blood pressure measurements in the renal denervation group reduced by 32/12 mm Hg (SD 23/11, baseline of 178/96 mm Hg, p{$<$}0·0001), whereas they did not differ from baseline in the control group (change of 1/0 mm Hg [21/10], baseline of 178/97 mm Hg, p=0·77 systolic and p=0·83 diastolic). Between-group differences in blood pressure at 6 months were 33/11 mm Hg (p{$<$}0·0001). At 6 months, 41 (84\%) of 49 patients who underwent renal denervation had a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more, compared with 18 (35\%) of 51 controls (p{$<$}0·0001). We noted no serious procedure-related or device-related complications and occurrence of adverse events did not differ between groups; one patient who had renal denervation had possible progression of an underlying atherosclerotic lesion, but required no treatment. Catheter-based renal denervation can safely be used to substantially reduce blood pressure in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. Ardian.}

We report a more reliable and scalable causal discovery method (iMIIC), based on a general mutual information supremum principle, which greatly improves the precision of inferred causal relations while distinguishing genuine causes from putative and latent causal effects. We showcase iMIIC on synthetic and real-world healthcare data from 396,179 breast cancer patients from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. More than 90\% of predicted causal effects appear correct, while the remaining unexpected direct and indirect causal effects can be interpreted in terms of diagnostic procedures, therapeutic timing, patient preference or socio-economic disparity. iMIIC's unique capabilities open up new avenues to discover reliable and interpretable causal networks across a range of research fields.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Objective To examine the associations between neuraxial anaesthesia or general anaesthesia and clinical outcomes, length of hospital stay, and readmission in adults undergoing lower limb revascularisation surgery. Design Comparative effectiveness study using linked, validated, population based databases. Setting Ontario, Canada, 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2015. Participants 20 988 patients Ontario residents aged 18 years or older who underwent their first lower limb revascularisation surgery in hospitals performing 50 or more of these surgeries annually. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was 30 day all cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital cardiopulmonary and renal complications, length of hospital stay, and 30 day readmissions. Multivariable, mixed effects regression models, adjusting for patient, procedural, and hospital characteristics, were used to estimate associations between anaesthetic technique and outcomes. Robustness of analyses were evaluated by conducting instrumental variable, propensity score matched, and survival sensitivity analyses. Results Of 20 988 patients who underwent lower limb revascularisation surgery, 6453 (30.7\%) received neuraxial anaesthesia and 14 535 (69.3\%) received general anaesthesia. The percentage of neuraxial anaesthesia use ranged from 0.6\% to 90.6\% across included hospitals. Furthermore, use of neuraxial anaesthesia declined by 17\% over the study period. Death within 30 days occurred in 204 (3.2\%) patients who received neuraxial anaesthesia and 646 (4.4\%) patients who received general anaesthesia. After multivariable, multilevel adjustment, use of neuraxial anaesthesia compared with use of general anaesthesia was associated with decreased 30 day mortality (absolute risk reduction 0.72\%, 95\% confidence interval 0.65\% to 0.79\%; odds ratio 0.68, 95\% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.83; number needed to treat to prevent one death=139). A similar direction and magnitude of association was found in instrumental variable, propensity score matched, and survival analyses. Use of neuraxial anaesthesia compared with use of general anaesthesia was also associated with decreased in-hospital cardiopulmonary and renal complications (odds ratio 0.73, 0.63 to 0.85) and a reduced length of hospital stay (−0.5 days, −0.3 to−0.6 days). Conclusions Use of neuraxial anaesthesia compared with general anaesthesia for lower limb revascularisation surgery was associated with decreased 30 day mortality and hospital length of stay. These findings might have been related to reduced cardiopulmonary and renal complications after neuraxial anaesthesia and support the increased use of neuraxial anaesthesia in patients undergoing these surgeries until the results of a large, confirmatory randomised trial become available.},

  abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.},

Using an aggregated resampling procedure, nonparticipants were matched to participants 1:1 based on trial conditions, number of recent visits to a health care professional, and calendar time.Clinical trial enrollment vs no enrollment.The primary outcome was standardized differences in clinical characteristics between participants and nonparticipants in clinical trials stratified into the 4 most common disease domains.This cross-sectional study included 1645 participants from 202 trials (929 [56.5\%] male; mean [SD] age, 54.65 [21.38] years) and an aggregated set of 1645 nonparticipants (855 [52.0\%] male; mean [SD] age, 57.24 [21.91] years). The most common disease domains for the selected trials were neoplastic disease (86 trials; 737 participants), disorders of the digestive system (31 trials; 321 participants), inflammatory disorders (28 trials; 276 participants), and disorders of the cardiovascular system (27 trials; 319 participants); trials could qualify for multiple disease domains. Among 31 conditions, the percentage of conditions for which the prevalence was lower among participants than among nonparticipants per standardized differences was 64.5\% (20 conditions) for neoplastic disease trials, 61.3\% (19) for digestive system trials, 58.1\% (18) for inflammatory disorder trials, and 38.7\% (12) for cardiovascular system trials. Among 17 medications, the percentage of medications for which use was less among participants than among nonparticipants per standardized differences was 64.7\% (11) for neoplastic disease trials, 58.8\% (10) for digestive system trials, 88.2\% (15) for inflammatory disorder trials, and 52.9\% (9) for cardiovascular system trials.Using a combination of electronic health record and trial enrollment data, this study found that clinical trial participants had fewer comorbidities and less use of medication than nonparticipants across a variety of disease domains. Combining trial enrollment data with electronic health record data may be useful for better understanding of the generalizability of trial results.}

A sample of 274 previously collected E. coli resistant to ceftriaxone (CRO), ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and/or nalidixic acid recovered from 102 travellers was studied. Travellers were assessed pre-travel then longitudinally (maximum 6~months) with peri-rectal/rectal swabs. Clonality was determined by REP-PCR and the presence of O25b-ST131 was assessed. Comparison was made longitudinally for individuals and between identified co-travellers. The risk of prolonged carriage was lower for CRO than for ciprofloxacin or gentamicin resistance. Repeated isolation of the same phenotype at different time points occurred in 19\% of initial CRO-resistant carriers compared with 50\% of ciprofloxacin- or gentamicin-resistant carriers. The duration of carriage was also longer for the latter resistance phenotypes (75th quartile 8 vs 62 and 63~days respectively). In multivariate analysis, risks of prolonged carriage included antimicrobial use whilst travelling (3.3, 1.3-8.4) and phylogenetic group B2 (9.3, 3.4-25.6) and D (3.8, 1.6-8.8). Clonality amongst longitudinal isolates from the same participant was demonstrated in 92\% of participants who were assessable and most marked amongst CRO-resistant isolates. ST-131 was surprisingly infrequent (3\% of participants). Prolonged carriage of ciprofloxacin- and gentamicin-resistant isolates is more frequent and prolonged than CRO resistance after travel. Risks of prolonged carriage indicate a contribution of host and bacterial factors to this carriage. These require further elucidation. The strong clonality identified suggests that carriage of a "phenotype" was mediated by persistence of bacteria/plasmid combinations rather than persistence of the plasmid after horizontal transfer to other bacteria.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground Erlotinib has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy when given as first-line treatment for Asian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC. Methods We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain. Eligible participants were adults (\&gt;18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending ≥6 months before study entry was allowed). We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m2 on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8). Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (≥1 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225. Findings Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled. One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy. The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended. At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9·7 months (95\% CI 8·4-12·3) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5·2 months (4·5–5·8) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·37, 95\% CI 0·25–0·54; p\&lt;0·0001). Main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (11 [13\%] of 84 patients given erlotinib vs none of 82 patients in the chemotherapy group), neutropenia (none vs 18 [22\%]), anaemia (one [1\%] vs three [4\%]), and increased amino-transferase concentrations (two [2\%] vs 0). Five (6\%) patients on erlotinib had treatment-related severe adverse events compared with 16 patients (20\%) on chemotherapy. One patient in the erlotinib group and two in the standard chemotherapy group died from treatment-related causes. Interpretation Our findings strengthen the rationale for routine baseline tissue-based assessment of EGFR mutations in patients with NSCLC and for treatment of mutation-positive patients with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.

This problem is increasingly relevant, as the modern era has yielded passive collection of massive observational datasets in areas such as e-commerce and electronic health. These data may be used to supplement experimental data, which is frequently expensive to obtain. In Rosenman et al. (2018), we considered this problem under the assumption that all confounders were measured. Here, we relax the assumption of unconfoundedness. To derive combined estimators with desirable properties, we make use of results from the Stein Shrinkage literature. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a generic procedure for deriving shrinkage estimators in this setting, making use of a generalized unbiased risk estimate. Second, we develop two new estimators, prove finite sample conditions under which they have lower risk than an estimator using only experimental data, and show that each achieves a notion of asymptotic optimality. Third, we draw connections between our approach and results in sensitivity analysis, including proposing a method for evaluating the feasibility of our estimators.},

Patients \&amp; methods: We retrospectively evaluated 33 patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 or 21), dividing them into sarcopenic patients, with low skeletal muscle index ≤39 cm2/m2 for women and ≤55 cm2/m2 for men, and nonsarcopenic patients. Results: Sarcopenia does not affect response to gefitinib treatment in EGFR mutated NSCLC patients, even if it is a bad prognostic indicator for overall survival (p = 0.035). Conclusion: Early recognition of sarcopenia is beneficial for prevention of cancer cachexia and detection of patients at potential risk of serious adverse events. Gefitinib dosage should be reduced and modulated in sarcopenic patients. © 2018 2018 Future Medicine Ltd.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of predicting a response variable from a set of covariates on a data set that differs in distribution from the training data. Causal parameters are optimal in terms of predictive accuracy if in the new distribution either many variables are affected by interventions or only some variables are affected, but the perturbations are strong. If the training and test distributions differ by a shift, causal parameters might be too conservative to perform well on the above task. This motivates anchor regression, a method that makes use of exogenous variables to solve a relaxation of the ‘causal’ minimax problem by considering a modification of the least-squares loss. The procedure naturally provides an interpolation between the solutions of ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares. We prove that the estimator satisfies predictive guarantees in terms of distributional robustness against shifts in a linear class; these guarantees are valid even if the instrumental variable assumptions are violated. If anchor regression and least squares provide the same answer (‘anchor stability’), we establish that OLS parameters are invariant under certain distributional changes. Anchor regression is shown empirically to improve replicability and protect against distributional shifts.}

The EDL source model has been validated in torso-tank models and animal experiments, however validation in humans using invasive electroanatomical mapping is limited. Purpose Validation of EDL based ECGi using invasive electroanatomical mapping. Methods Ten patients referred for epicardial and endocardial electroanatomical mapping underwent 67 electrode body surface potential mapping (BSPM), cardiac CT imaging and 3D imaging of electrode positions. Anatomical models of the ventricles, lungs and thorax were created and supplemented with electrode positions. Invasive epicardial (4020±1514 contact points), right ventricle endocardial (724±113 contact points) and left ventricle endocardial (459±117 contact points) local activation timing (LAT) maps were compared to ECGi derived LAT maps. Results Included patients (mean age 48±21 years, 80\% males) were diagnosed with either arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (N=4), dilated cardiomyopathy (N=1), symptomatic premature ventricular complexes (N=3) or myocarditis (N=2). Measured BSMP highly correlated with simulated BSPM (97±2\%) with a relative difference of 24\% ± 6\%. Source models consisted of a mean of 2614±214 nodes with a mean distance between nodes of 8.3±1 mm. Overall, invasive LAT maps and ECGi derived LAT maps showed reasonable correlation for epicardial maps (49\% ± 18\%) and endocardial maps of the right ventricle (48\% ± 27\%). Endocardial left ventricular LAT maps showed less correlation (23\% ± 28). The absolute difference between invasive and ECGi LAT maps was 16.7±14.2 ms for epicardial maps, 17.2±12.9 ms for right ventricle endocardial maps and 34.0±19.8 ms for left ventricle endocardial maps. Visual comparison showed corresponding areas of breakthrough and regions of latest activation in all cases (Figure). Quantitative comparison of these areas showed a mean absolute difference of 33±7mm or 19±10 ms for epicardial maps, 25±10 mm or 17±13 ms for right ventricle endocardial maps and 39±16 mm or 20±6 ms for left ventricular endocardial maps. Conclusion Overall agreement was observed between EDL based ECGi LAT maps and electroanatomical LAT maps. Future research will focus on further quantification of this agreement and improvement of ECGi mapping accuracy. Funding Acknowledgement Type of funding source: Foundation.

  abstract = {Spline functions provide a useful and flexible basis for modeling relationships with continuous predictors. However, to limit instability and provide sensible regression models in the multivariable setting, a principled approach to model selection and function estimation is important. Here the multivariable fractional polynomials approach to model building is transferred to regression splines. The essential features are specifying a maximum acceptable complexity for each continuous function and applying a closed-test approach to each continuous predictor to simplify the model where possible. Important adjuncts are an initial choice of scale for continuous predictors (linear or logarithmic), which often helps one to generate realistic, parsimonious final models; a goodness-of-fit test for a parametric function of a predictor; and a preliminary predictor transformation to improve robustness.}

  abstract = {Introduction Immunotherapy is effective in a small percentage of patients with cancer and no reliable predictive biomarkers are currently available. Artificial Intelligence algorithms may automatically quantify radiologic characteristics associated with disease response to medical treatments. Methods We investigated an innovative approach based on a 3-dimensional (3D) deep radiomics pipeline to classify visual features of chest-abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans with the aim of distinguishing disease control from progressive disease to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Forty-two consecutive patients with metastatic urothelial cancer had progressed on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and had baseline CT scans at immunotherapy initiation. The 3D-pipeline included self-learned visual features and a deep self-attention mechanism. According to the outcome to the ICIs, a 3D deep classifier semiautomatically categorized the most discriminative region of interest on the CT scans. Results With a median follow-up of 13.3 months (95\% CI, 11.1-15.6), the median overall survival was 8.5 months (95\% CI, 3.1-13.8). According to disease response to immunotherapy, the median overall survival was 3.6 months (95\% CI, 2.0-5.2) for patients with progressive disease; it was not yet reached for those with disease control. The predictive accuracy of the 3D-pipeline was 82.5\% (sensitivity 96\%; specificity, 60\%). The addition of baseline clinical factors increased the accuracy to 92.5\% by improving specificity to 87\%; the accuracy of other architectures ranged from 72.5\% to 90\%. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence by 3D deep radiomics is a potential noninvasive biomarker for the prediction of disease control to ICIs in metastatic urothelial cancer and deserves validation in larger series.},

  abstract = {It has frequently been shown that patients with cancer are one of the largest hospital patient groups with a prevalence for malnutrition. Weight loss is a frequent manifestation of malnutrition in patients with cancer. Several large-scale studies over the past 35 y have reported that involuntary weight loss affects 50\% to 80\% of these patients with the degree of weight loss dependent on tumor site and type and stage of disease. The aim of this review was to determine the consequences of malnutrition, weight loss, and muscle wasting in relation to chemotherapy tolerance, postoperative complications, quality of life, and survival in patients with cancer. The prognostic impact of weight loss on overall survival has long been recognised with recent data suggesting losses as little as 2.4\% predicts survival independent of disease, site, stage or performance score. Recently the use of gold-standard methods of body composition assessment, including computed tomography, have led to an increased understanding of the importance of muscle abnormalities, such as low muscle mass (sarcopenia), and more recently low muscle attenuation, as important prognostic indicators of unfavourable outcomes in patients with cancer. Muscle abnormalities are highly prevalent (ranging from 10–90\%, depending on cancer site and the diagnostic criteria used). Both low muscle mass and low muscle attenuation have been associated with poorer tolerance to chemotherapy; increased risk of postoperative complications; significant deterioration in a patients' performance status, and poorer psychological well-being, overall quality of life, and survival.},

  abstract = {Many psychological phenomena can be understood as systems of causally connected components that evolve over time within an individual. In current empirical practice, researchers frequently study these systems by fitting statistical models to data collected at a single moment in time, that is, cross-sectional data. This poses a central question: Can cross-sectional data analysis ever yield causal insights into systems that evolve over time, and if so, under what conditions? In this paper, we address this question by introducing Equilibrium Causal Models (ECMs) to the psychological literature. ECMs are causal abstractions of an underlying dynamical system that allow for inferences about the long-term effects of interventions, permit cyclic causal relationships, and can in principle be estimated from cross-sectional data, as long as information about the resting state of the system is captured by those measurements. We explain the conditions under which ECM estimation is possible, show that they allow researchers to learn about within-person processes from cross-sectional data, and discuss how tools from both psychological measurement modeling and the causal discovery literature can inform the ways in which researchers collect and analyze their data.},

We also considered possible accumulation mechanisms in our data set. PATIENTS AND METHODS: On the basis of PE status from chest computed tomography scans at diagnosis, 2,061 patients were classified into three groups: no PE, minimal PE, and malignant PE. Twenty-one variables associated with four factors-patient, stage migration, tumor, and treatment-were investigated for correlation with survival. RESULTS: Minimal PE presented in 272 patients (13.2\%). Of 2,061 patients, the proportion of each stage was the following: 5.2\% stage I, 10.9\% stage II, 13.2\% stage IIIA, 23.8\% stage IIIB, and 13.9\% stage IV.

In this case-control study of nulliparous women, we test the hypothesis that increased exposure to paternal seminal fluid via the vaginal or oral route will confer a reduced risk of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia cases (n=258) and normotensive controls (n=182) were selected from live births to Iowa women over the period August 2002 to April 2005. Disease status was verified by medical chart review. Seminal fluid exposure indexes incorporated information on type and frequency of sexual practices, contraceptive use, and ingestion practices prior to conception with the baby's father. Preeclampsia risk decreased significantly with increasing vaginal exposure to paternal semen (test for trend p{$<$}0.05). Women in the highest 10th percentile of vaginal exposure had a 70\% reduced odds of preeclampsia relative to women in the lowest 25th percentile of exposure (aOR=0.3; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.9). Oral seminal fluid exposure was not associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia. These findings are congruent with the immune maladaptation hypothesis of preeclampsia causation and indicate that paternal antigen exposure via the vaginal mucosa may facilitate immune tolerance to paternal HLA. Thus, advising nulliparous women to decrease their use of barrier contraceptive methods and to increase vaginal sexual intercourse prior to conceiving may reduce their risk of preeclampsia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is the standard treatment for early-stage medically inoperable lung cancer. Predictors of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients treated with SABR are poorly defined. In this study, we investigate clinical and dosimetric parameters, which can predict symptomatic radiation RP in early-stage lung cancer patients treated with SABR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients treated with lung SABR between May 2009 and August 2018, in a single United Kingdom (UK) radiotherapy center were included. The patient's baseline characteristics, treatment details, and toxicity were retrieved from the electronic medical record. Dosimetric data was extracted from Xio and Monaco treatment planning systems. Patients were treated according to the UK SABR consortium guidelines. RP was graded retrospectively using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, based on available clinical and imaging information. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was performed to determine predictive factors for grade ≥2 radiation pneumonitis, using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) statistics version 21 software. The goodness of fit was assessed using the Hosmer and Lemeshow test. The optimal diagnostic threshold was tested using the Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The chi-square test was carried out to test the different risk factors against the likelihood of developing grade ≥2 pneumonitis. RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients included in the analysis. The median age of patients was 75 years. Six hundred sixty-six patients (52.6\%) were female. Median follow up was 56 months. Sixty-five percent of patients received 55Gy in 5 fractions. Forty-three percent of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2 and 16.2\% had PS of 3. The Median Charlson comorbidity index was 6 (range 2-11). Median Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) max of the tumor was 6.5. Four hundred two patients (31.8\%) had confirmed histological diagnosis; other patients were treated based on a radiological diagnosis. The median tumor size was 20mm (range 4mm-63mm). Median Planning Target Volume(PTV) was 30.3 cc. Median values of R100, R50, and D2cm were 1.1, 5.6, 32.8Gy. The median value of mean lung dose, V20, and V12.5 were 3.9Gy, 5 \%and 9.3\% respectively. Eighty-five (6.7\%) patients developed symptomatic RP (grade ≥2) with only 5(0.4\%) developing grade 3 RP. Five percent of patients developed rib fractures but only 28\% of these were symptomatic. On univariate analysis lower lobe tumor location, larger tumor size, PTV, mean lung dose, lung V20Gy, and V12.5Gy were significantly associated with grade ≥2 RP. On multivariate analysis, only mean lung dose was associated with grade ≥2 pneumonitis (Table 1). ROC curve analysis showed optimal diagnostic threshold for tumour size, PTV , mean lung dose, V20 and V12.5 (Figure 1); are 22.5mm ((Area Under Curve(AUC)- 0.565)), 27.15cc (AUC-0.58), 3.7Gy (AUC- 0.633), 4.6\% (AUC-0.597), 9.5\% (AUC-0.616).The incidence of ≥grade 2 RP was significantly high for values higher than the ROC threshold. CONCLUSION: SABR treatment resulted in a very low rate of grade 3 pneumonitis. Lower lobe tumor location, larger tumor size, PTV, mean lung dose, V20, and V12.5 were found to be significant predictors of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis.},

  abstract = {AbstractBackground Although renal sympathetic denervation therapy has shown promising results in patients with resistant~hypertension, the human anatomy of peri-arterial renal nerves is poorly understood. Objectives The aim of our study was to investigate the anatomic distribution of peri-arterial sympathetic nerves around human renal arteries. Methods Bilateral renal arteries were collected from human autopsy subjects, and peri-arterial renal nerve anatomy was examined by using morphometric software. The ratio of afferent to efferent nerve fibers was investigated by dual immunofluorescence staining using antibodies targeted for anti–tyrosine hydroxylase and anti–calcitonin gene–related peptide. Results A total of 10,329 nerves were identified from 20 (12 hypertensive and 8 nonhypertensive) patients. The mean individual number of nerves in the proximal and middle segments was similar (39.6 ± 16.7 per section and 39.9 ± 1 3.9 per section), whereas the distal segment showed fewer nerves (33.6 ± 13.1 per section) (p~= 0.01). Mean subject-specific nerve distance to arterial lumen was greatest in proximal segments (3.40 ± 0.78 mm), followed by middle segments (3.10~±~0.69 mm), and least in distal segments (2.60 ± 0.77 mm) (p~\&lt; 0.001). The mean number of nerves in the ventral region (11.0 ± 3.5 per section) was greater compared with the dorsal region (6.2 ± 3.0 per section) (p~\&lt; 0.001). Efferent nerve fibers were predominant (tyrosine hydroxylase/calcitonin gene–related peptide ratio 25.1 ± 33.4; p~\&lt; 0.0001). Nerve anatomy in hypertensive patients was not considerably different compared with nonhypertensive patients. Conclusions The density of peri-arterial renal sympathetic nerve fibers is lower in distal segments and dorsal locations. There is a clear predominance of efferent nerve fibers, with decreasing prevalence of afferent nerves from~proximal to distal peri-arterial and renal parenchyma. Understanding these anatomic patterns is important for refinement of renal denervation procedures.},

  abstract = {Background The use of baseline tumor burden (TB) as a prognostic factor for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and associations between TB and other prognostic biomarkers remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the association between TB and survival in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs in comparison with other biomarkers. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 83 NSCLC patients with ICIs administered between February 2016 and December 2018. TB was measured as the sum of the unidimensional diameters of up to five target lesions. Results The median observation period was 14.2 months. A total of 42 patients died during the follow-up. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that baseline TB was associated with OS. Cox regression analysis adjusted for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) alone or with addition of programmed cell death ligand 1 expression and treatment line showed that TB was a prognostic factor for OS. Using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal TB cutoff for predicting OS was 12 cm, and patients were divided into a high TB group (n = 21) and a low TB group (n = 62). The low TB group achieved significantly longer OS than the high TB group (median OS: 18.5 months, [95\% CI = 11.7-not reached] vs. 2.3 months [95\% CI = 1.3–2.9], P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion TB is a useful, clinically measurable prognostic factor of survival in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study aims to develop a robust gene expression classifier that can predict disease relapse in patients with early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients and Methods Fresh frozen tumor tissue from 188 patients with stage I to IV CRC undergoing surgery was analyzed using Agilent 44K oligonucleotide arrays. Median follow-up time was 65.1 months, and the majority of patients (83.6\%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. A nearest mean classifier was developed using a cross-validation procedure to score all genes for their association with 5-year distant metastasis–free survival. Results An optimal set of 18 genes was identified and used to construct a prognostic classifier (ColoPrint). The signature was validated on an independent set of 206 samples from patients with stage I, II, and III CRC. The signature classified 60\% of patients as low risk and 40\% as high risk. Five-year relapse-free survival rates were 87.6\% (95\% CI, 81.5\% to 93.7\%) and 67.2\% (95\% CI, 55.4\% to 79.0\%) for low- and high-risk patients, respectively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.5 (95\% CI, 1.33 to 4.73; P = .005). In multivariate analysis, the signature remained one of the most significant prognostic factors, with an HR of 2.69 (95\% CI, 1.41 to 5.14; P = .003). In patients with stage II CRC, the signature had an HR of 3.34 (P = .017) and was superior to American Society of Clinical Oncology criteria in assessing the risk of cancer recurrence without prescreening for microsatellite instability (MSI). Conclusion ColoPrint significantly improves the prognostic accuracy of pathologic factors and MSI in patients with stage II and III CRC and facilitates the identification of patients with stage II disease who may be safely managed without chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments benefit some patients with metastatic cancers, but predictive biomarkers are needed. Findings in selected cancer types suggest that tumor mutational burden (TMB) may predict clinical response to ICI. To examine this association more broadly, we analyzed the clinical and genomic data of 1,662 advanced cancer patients treated with ICI, and 5,371 non-ICI-treated patients, whose tumors underwent targeted next-generation sequencing (MSK-IMPACT). Among all patients, higher somatic TMB (highest 20\% in each histology) was associated with better overall survival. For most cancer histologies, an association between higher TMB and improved survival was observed. The TMB cutpoints associated with improved survival varied markedly between cancer types. These data indicate that TMB is associated with improved survival in patients receiving ICI across a wide variety of cancer types, but that there may not be one universal definition of high TMB.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and pain are important supportive cancer care outcomes. The patient-provider relationship, a modifiable care experience, has been linked to healthcare outcomes; however, less is known about associations between patient-provider relationship and supportive care outcomes in cancer patients. We examined the role of multiple aspects of the patient-provider relationship in explaining patterns of HRQOL and pain among breast and lung cancer patients. METHODS: Our analysis included 283 breast and lung cancer patients from two cancer centers. Clinical data and survey data on patient sociodemographic factors, physical and mental HRQOL, pain, and patient-physician relationship (i.e., doctor's respectfulness, time spent with doctors, patient involvement in decision-making, satisfaction with care, and following doctor's advice/treatment plan) were collected at baseline and during treatment. We estimated adjusted modified Poisson regression models to assess associations between patient-physician relationship factors and physical and mental HRQOL and pain. RESULTS: Compared with patients reporting suboptimal respect from doctors, patients reporting optimal respect were less likely to report below average physical HRQOL (adjusted risk ratio (ARR), 0.73; 95\%CI, 0.62-0.86), below average mental HRQOL (ARR, 0.71; 95\%CI, 0.54-0.93), and moderate-to-severe pain (ARR, 0.53; 95\%CI, 0.35-0.79). Patients reporting optimal involvement in care decision-making and patients who reported following their doctor's advice/treatment plan were less likely to report below average mental HRQOL than their respective counterparts (ARR, 0.64; 95\%CI, 0.50-0.83; ARR, 0.65; 95\%CI, 0.48-0.86). CONCLUSION: Multiple patient-physician relationship factors account for variations in HRQOL and pain in cancer patients. These findings provide insight into potential targets for improving the patient-provider relationship and supportive cancer care outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Labeled medical imaging data is scarce and expensive to generate. To achieve generalizable deep learning models large amounts of data are needed. Standard data augmentation is a method to increase generalizability and is routinely performed. Generative adversarial networks offer a novel method for data augmentation. We evaluate the use of CycleGAN for data augmentation in CT segmentation tasks. Using a large image database we trained a CycleGAN to transform contrast CT images into non-contrast images. We then used the trained CycleGAN to augment our training using these synthetic non-contrast images. We compared the segmentation performance of a U-Net trained on the original dataset compared to a U-Net trained on the combined dataset of original data and synthetic non-contrast images. We further evaluated the U-Net segmentation performance on two separate datasets: The original contrast CT dataset on which segmentations were created and a second dataset from a different hospital containing only non-contrast CTs. We refer to these 2 separate datasets as the in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, respectively. We show that in several CT segmentation tasks performance is improved significantly, especially in out-of-distribution (noncontrast CT) data. For example, when training the model with standard augmentation techniques, performance of segmentation of the kidneys on out-of-distribution non-contrast images was dramatically lower than for in-distribution data (Dice score of 0.09 vs. 0.94 for out-of-distribution vs. in-distribution data, respectively, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). When the kidney model was trained with CycleGAN augmentation techniques, the out-of-distribution (non-contrast) performance increased dramatically (from a Dice score of 0.09 to 0.66, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Improvements for the liver and spleen were smaller, from 0.86 to 0.89 and 0.65 to 0.69, respectively. We believe this method will be valuable to medical imaging researchers to reduce manual segmentation effort and cost in CT imaging.},

The efferent postganglionic sympathetic renal nerves were studied using the glyoxylic acid histofluorescence technique to identify renal tissue adrenergic amines (Grade 0-4). The afferent sensory renal nerves were studied by the systemic blood pressure response to renal arterial injection of capsaicin. In 8 control dogs with native innervated kidneys (Group I), intrarenal injection of capsaicin significantly increased the systemic blood pressure from baseline by 32.4 +/- 6.3 mm. Hg (p less than 0.01). This response was equivalent to the blood pressure increase following injection of capsaicin into the mesenteric artery which was 37.3 +/- 9.8 mm. Hg. The renal tissue histofluorescence grade in this group was 4. Six dogs were studied two to three weeks after autotransplantation of a solitary kidney (Group II). Intrarenal injection of capsaicin did not increase the systemic blood pressure in these animals. Three dogs in this group had no evidence of renal tissue adrenergic amines by histofluorescence (Grade 0); the remaining two animals had renal tissue histofluorescence grades of 1 and 2. Eight dogs were studied 12 to 35 months after autotransplantation of a solitary kidney (Group III). Intrarenal injection of capsaicin in these animals significantly increased the systemic blood pressure from baseline by 10 +/- 1.4 mm. Hg (p less than 0.001). The renal tissue histofluorescence grade in this group ranged from 1 to 3.

Although it is primarily a disease of the elderly, its development may be associated with conditions that are not exclusively seen in older persons. Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength and it is strictly correlated with physical disability, poor quality of life and death. Risk factors for sarcopenia include age, gender and level of physical activity. In conditions such as malignancy, rheumatoid arthritis and aging, lean body mass is lost while fat mass may be preserved or even increased. The loss in muscle mass may be associated with increased body fat so that despite normal weight there is marked weakness, this is a condition called sarcopenic obesity. There is an important correlation between inactivity and losses of muscle mass and strength, this suggests that physical activity should be a protective factor for the prevention but also the management of sarcopenia. Furthermore one of the first step to be taken for a person with sarcopenia or clinical frailty is to ensure that the sarcopenic patient is receiving correct and sufficient nutrition. Sarcopenia has a greater effect on survival. It should be important to prevent or postpone as much as possible the onset of this condition, to enhance survival and to reduce the demand for long-term care. Interventions for sarcopenia need to be developed with most attention on exercise and nutritional interventions.},

FLT PET standardized uptake values (SUVs) were extracted from tumors, non-metastatic lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, pancreas, and thyroid to quantify cell proliferation in these tissues. Regional immune cell responses to pTVG-HP DNA vaccine were assessed by comparing FLT uptake changes in vaccine draining and non-draining lymph nodes. Cox proportional hazards regression was utilized to relate FLT uptake and other clinical markers (PSA and tumor size) to progression-free survival. Area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves and concordance indices were used to assess the predictive capabilities of FLT uptake. Results Changes in FLT uptake in vaccine draining lymph nodes were significantly greater than changes in non-draining lymph nodes (P = 0.02), suggesting a regional immune response to vaccination. However, the changes in FLT uptake in lymph nodes were not significantly predictive of progression-free survival. Increases in tumor FLT uptake were significantly predictive of shorter progression-free survival (concordance index = 0.83, P {$<$} 0.01). Baseline FLT uptake in the thyroid was significantly predictive of whether or not a patient would subsequently experience a thyroid-related adverse event (AUC = 0.97, P {$<$} 0.01). Conclusions FLT PET uptake was significantly predictive of progression-free survival and the occurrence of adverse events relating to thyroid function. The results suggest FLT PET imaging has potential as a biomarker in immunotherapy, providing a marker of tumor and immune responses, and as a possible means of anticipating specific immune-related adverse events.

  abstract = {Essential hypertension remains one of the biggest challenges in medicine with an enormous impact on both individual and society levels. With the exception of relatively rare monogenetic forms of hypertension, there is now general agreement that the condition is multifactorial in nature and hence requires therapeutic approaches targeting several aspects of the underlying pathophysiology. Accordingly, all major guidelines promote a combination of lifestyle interventions and combination pharmacotherapy to reach target blood pressure (BP) levels in order to reduce overall cardiovascular risk in affected patients. Although this approach works for many, it fails in a considerable number of patients for various reasons including drug-intolerance, noncompliance, physician inertia, and others, leaving them at unacceptably high cardiovascular risk. The quest for additional therapeutic approaches to safely and effectively manage hypertension continues and expands to the reappraisal of older concepts such as renal denervation. Based on the robust preclinical and clinical data surrounding the role of renal sympathetic nerves in various aspects of BP control very recent efforts have led to the development of a novel catheter-based approach using radiofrequency (RF) energy to selectively target and disrupt the renal nerves. The available evidence from the limited number of uncontrolled hypertensive patients in whom renal denervation has been performed are auspicious and indicate that the procedure has a favorable safety profile and is associated with a substantial and presumably sustained BP reduction. Although promising, a myriad of questions are far from being conclusively answered and require our concerted research efforts to explore the full potential and possible risks of this approach. Here we briefly review the science surrounding renal denervation, summarize the current data on safety and efficacy of renal nerve ablation, and discuss some of the open questions that need to be addressed in the near future.}

  abstract = {If the control rate (CR) in a clinical trial represents the incidence or the baseline severity of illness in the study population, the size of treatment effects may tend to very with the size of control rates. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined 115 meta-analyses covering a wide range of medical applications for evidence of a linear relationship between the CR and three treatment effect (TE) measures: the risk difference (RD); the log relative risk (RR), and the log odds ratio (OR). We used a hierarchical model that estimates the true regression while accounting for the random error in the measurement of and the functional dependence between the observed TE and the CR. Using a two standard error rule of significance, we found the control rate was about two times more likely to be significantly related to the RD (31 per cent) than to the RR (13 per cent) or the OR (14 per cent). Correlations between TE and CR were more likely when the meta-analysis included 10 or more trials and if patient follow-up was less than six months and homogeneous. Use of weighted linear regression (WLR) of the observed TE on the observed CR instead of the hierarchical model underestimated standard errors and overestimated the number of significant results by a factor of two. The significant correlation between the CR and the TE suggests that, rather than merely pooling the TE into a single summary estimate, investigators should search for the causes of heterogeneity related to patient characteristics and treatment protocols to determine when treatment is most beneficial and that they should plan to study this heterogeneity in clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Background Background A major determinant of treatment offered to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is their intrathoracic (mediastinal) nodal status. If the disease has not spread to the ipsilateral mediastinal nodes, subcarinal (N2) nodes, or both, and the patient is otherwise considered fit for surgery, resection is often the treatment of choice. Planning the optimal treatment is therefore critically dependent on accurate staging of the disease. PET-CT (positron emission tomography–computed tomography) is a non-invasive staging method of the mediastinum, which is increasingly available and used by lung cancer multidisciplinary teams. Although the non-invasive nature of PET-CT constitutes one of its major advantages, PET-CT may be suboptimal in detecting malignancy in normal-sized lymph nodes and in ruling out malignancy in patients with coexisting inflammatory or infectious diseases. Objectives Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of integrated PET-CT for mediastinal staging of patients with suspected or confirmed NSCLC that is potentially suitable for treatment with curative intent. Search methods Search methods We searched the following databases up to 30 April 2013: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via OvidSP (from 1946), Embase via OvidSP (from 1974), PreMEDLINE via OvidSP, OpenGrey, ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses, and the trials register www.clinicaltrials.gov. There were no language or publication status restrictions on the search. We also contacted researchers in the field, checked reference lists, and conducted citation searches (with an end-date of 9 July 2013) of relevant studies. Selection criteria Selection criteria Prospective or retrospective cross-sectional studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of integrated PET-CT for diagnosing N2 disease in patients with suspected resectable NSCLC. The studies must have used pathology as the reference standard and reported participants as the unit of analysis. Data collection and analysis Data collection and analysis Two authors independently extracted data pertaining to the study characteristics and the number of true and false positives and true and false negatives for the index test, and they independently assessed the quality of the included studies using QUADAS-2. We calculated sensitivity and specificity with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for each study and performed two main analyses based on the criteria for test positivity employed: Activity {$>$} background or SUVmax ≥ 2.5 (SUVmax = maximum standardised uptake value), where we fitted a summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using a hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) model for each subset of studies. We identified the average operating point on the SROC curve and computed the average sensitivities and specificities. We checked for heterogeneity and examined the robustness of the meta-analyses through sensitivity analyses. Main results Main results We included 45 studies, and based on the criteria for PET-CT positivity, we categorised the included studies into three groups: Activity {$>$} background (18 studies, N = 2823, prevalence of N2 and N3 nodes = 679/2328), SUVmax ≥ 2.5 (12 studies, N = 1656, prevalence of N2 and N3 nodes = 465/1656), and Other/mixed (15 studies, N = 1616, prevalence of N2 to N3 nodes = 400/1616). None of the studies reported (any) adverse events. Under-reporting generally hampered the quality assessment of the studies, and in 30/45 studies, the applicability of the study populations was of high or unclear concern. The summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for the 'Activity {$>$} background PET-CT positivity criterion were 77.4\% (95\% CI 65.3 to 86.1) and 90.1\% (95\% CI 85.3 to 93.5), respectively, but the accuracy estimates of these studies in ROC space showed a wide prediction region. This indicated high between-study heterogeneity and a relatively large 95\% confidence region around the summary value of sensitivity and specificity, denoting a lack of precision. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the overall estimate of sensitivity was especially susceptible to selection bias; reference standard bias; clear definition of test positivity; and to a lesser extent, index test bias and commercial funding bias, with lower combined estimates of sensitivity observed for all the low 'Risk of bias' studies compared with the full analysis. The summary sensitivity and specificity estimates for the SUVmax ≥ 2.5 PET-CT positivity criterion were 81.3\% (95\% CI 70.2 to 88.9) and 79.4\% (95\% CI 70 to 86.5), respectively.In this group, the accuracy estimates of these studies in ROC space also showed a very wide prediction region. This indicated very high between-study heterogeneity, and there was a relatively large 95\% confidence region around the summary value of sensitivity and specificity, denoting a clear lack of precision. Sensitivity analyses suggested that both overall accuracy estimates were marginally sensitive to flow and timing bias and commercial funding bias, which both lead to slightly lower estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Heterogeneity analyses showed that the accuracy estimates were significantly influenced by country of study origin, percentage of participants with adenocarcinoma, (¹⁸F)-2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) dose, type of PET-CT scanner, and study size, but not by study design, consecutive recruitment, attenuation correction, year of publication, or tuberculosis incidence rate per 100,000 population. Authors' conclusions Authors' conclusions This review has shown that accuracy of PET-CT is insufficient to allow management based on PET-CT alone. The findings therefore support National Institute for Health and Care (formally 'clinical') Excellence (NICE) guidance on this topic, where PET-CT is used to guide clinicians in the next step: either a biopsy or where negative and nodes are small, directly to surgery. The apparent difference between the two main makes of PET-CT scanner is important and may influence the treatment decision in some circumstances. The differences in PET-CT accuracy estimates between scanner makes, NSCLC subtypes, FDG dose, and country of study origin, along with the general variability of results, suggest that all large centres should actively monitor their accuracy. This is so that they can make reliable decisions based on their own results and identify the populations in which PET-CT is of most use or potentially little value.},

This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, that is, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.},

  abstract = {Many modern estimators require bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals because either no analytic standard error is available or the distribution of the parameter of interest is non-symmetric. It remains however unclear how to obtain valid bootstrap inference when dealing with multiple imputation to address missing data. We present four methods which are intuitively appealing, easy to implement, and combine bootstrap estimation with multiple imputation. We show that three of the four approaches yield valid inference, but that the performance of the methods varies with respect to the number of imputed data sets and the extent of missingness. Simulation studies reveal the behavior of our approaches in finite samples. A topical analysis from HIV treatment research, which determines the optimal timing of antiretroviral treatment initiation in young children, demonstrates the practical implications of the four methods in a sophisticated and realistic setting. This analysis suffers from missing data and uses the g-formula for inference, a method for which no standard errors are available.},

Methods The local institutional ethics committee approved this retrospective study and waived informed patient consent. 103 patients with immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma were randomly divided into training (n\,=\,69) and validation cohort (n\,=\,34). Baseline tumor markers (LDH, S100B), baseline CT imaging biomarkers (tumor burden, Choi density) and CT texture parameters (Entropy, Kurtosis, Skewness, uniformity, MPP, UPP) of the largest target lesion were extracted. To identify treatment response predictors, binary logistic regression analysis was performed in the training cohort and tested in the validation cohort. For OS, Cox regression and Kaplan Maier analyses were performed in the training cohort. Bivariate and multivariate models were established. Goodness of fit was assessed with Harrell’s C-index. Potential predictors were tested in the validation cohort also using Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results Baseline S100B (Hazard ratio(HR)\,=\,2.543, p0.018), tumor burden (HR\,=\,1.657, p\,=\,0.002) and Kurtosis (HR\,=\,2.484, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) were independent predictors of OS and were confirmed in the validation cohort (p\,{$<$}\,0.048). Tumor burden and Kurtosis showed incremental predictive capacity allowing a good predictive model when combined with baseline S100B levels (C-index\,=\,0.720). Only S100B was predictive of treatment response (OR\,≤\,0.630, p\,≤\,0.022). Imaging biomarkers did not predict treatment response. Conclusion We identified easily obtainable baseline clinical (S100B) and CT predictors (tumor burden and Kurtosis) of OS in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing immunotherapy. However, imaging predictors did not predict treatment response.},

Despite its significance, a consensus on the correct measurement of predictive uncertainty remains elusive. In this work, we return to first principles to develop a fundamental framework of information-theoretic predictive uncertainty measures. Our proposed framework categorizes predictive uncertainty measures according to two factors: (I) The predicting model (II) The approximation of the true predictive distribution. Examining all possible combinations of these two factors, we derive a set of predictive uncertainty measures that includes both known and newly introduced ones. We empirically evaluate these measures in typical uncertainty estimation settings, such as misclassification detection, selective prediction, and out-of-distribution detection. The results show that no single measure is universal, but the effectiveness depends on the specific setting. Thus, our work provides clarity about the suitability of predictive uncertainty measures by clarifying their implicit assumptions and relationships.},

The challenge can be seen in two halves: identifying predictive markers, which guide the development/use of tailored therapies; and identifying prognostic markers, which guide other aspects of care and clinical trial planning, i.e. prognostic markers can be considered as covariates for stratification. Mistakenly assuming a biomarker to be predictive, when it is in fact largely prognostic (and vice-versa) is highly undesirable, and can result in financial, ethical and personal consequences. We present a framework for data-driven ranking of biomarkers on their prognostic/predictive strength, using a novel information theoretic method. This approach provides a natural algebra to discuss and quantify the individual predictive and prognostic strength, in a self-consistent mathematical framework.Our contribution is a novel procedure, INFO+, which naturally distinguishes the prognostic versus predictive role of each biomarker and handles higher order interactions. In a comprehensive empirical evaluation INFO+\,outperforms more complex methods, most notably when noise factors dominate, and biomarkers are likely to be falsely identified as predictive, when in fact they are just strongly prognostic. Furthermore, we show that our methods can be 1–3 orders of magnitude faster than competitors, making it useful for biomarker discovery in ‘big data’ scenarios. Finally, we apply our methods to identify predictive biomarkers on two real clinical trials, and introduce a new graphical representation that provides greater insight into the prognostic and predictive strength of each biomarker.R implementations of the suggested methods are available at https://github.com/sechidis.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

  abstract = {The past several decades have seen rapid advances in diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke, enabled by technological breakthroughs in imaging, genomics, and physiological monitoring, coupled with therapeutic interventions. We now face the challenge of how to (1) rapidly process large, complex multimodal and multiscale medical measurements; (2) map all available data streams to the trajectories of disease states over the patient's lifetime; and (3) apply this information for optimal clinical interventions and outcomes. Here we review new advances that may address these challenges using digital twin technology to fulfill the promise of personalized cardiovascular medical practice. Rooted in engineering mechanics and manufacturing, the digital twin is a virtual representation engineered to model and simulate its physical counterpart. Recent breakthroughs in scientific computation, artificial intelligence, and sensor technology have enabled rapid bidirectional interactions between the virtual‐physical counterparts with measurements of the physical twin that inform and improve its virtual twin, which in turn provide updated virtual projections of disease trajectories and anticipated clinical outcomes. Verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification builds confidence and trust by clinicians and patients in the digital twin and establishes boundaries for the use of simulations in cardiovascular medicine. Mechanistic physiological models form the fundamental building blocks of the personalized digital twin that continuously forecast optimal management of cardiovascular health using individualized data streams. We present exemplars from the existing body of literature pertaining to mechanistic model development for cardiovascular dynamics and summarize existing technical challenges and opportunities pertaining to the foundation of a digital twin.},

It distinguished risk modeling, which develops a multivariable model predicting individual baseline risk of study outcomes and examines treatment effects across risk strata, from effect modeling, which directly estimates individual treatment effects from models that include treatment, multiple patient characteristics and interactions of treatment with selected characteristics.                                   Purpose             To identify, describe and evaluate findings from reports that cite the Statement and present predictive modeling of HTE in RCTs.                                   Data Extraction             We identified reports using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, SCOPUS through July 5, 2024. Using double review with adjudication, we assessed consistency with Statement recommendations, credibility of HTE findings (applying criteria adapted from the Instrument to assess Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN)), and clinical importance of credible findings.                                   Results             We identified 65 reports (presenting 31 risk models, 41 effect models). Contrary to Statement recommendations, only 25 of 48 studies with positive overall findings included a risk model; most effect models included multiple predictors with little prior evidence for HTE. Claims of HTE were noted in 23 risk modeling and 31 effect modeling reports, but risk modeling met credibility criteria more frequently (87 vs 32 percent). For effect models, external validation of HTE findings was critical in establishing credibility. Credible HTE from either approach was usually judged clinically important (24 of 30). In 19 reports from trials suggesting overall treatment benefits, modeling identified subgroups of 5-67\% of patients predicted to experience no benefit or net treatment harm. In five that found no overall benefit, subgroups of 25-60\% of patients were nevertheless predicted to benefit.                                   Conclusions             Multivariable predictive modeling identified credible, clinically important HTE in one third of 65 reports. Risk modeling found credible HTE more frequently; effect modeling analyses were usually exploratory, but external validation served to increase credibility.},

  abstract = {Background Body composition plays an important role in predicting treatment outcomes in adults with cancer. Using existing computed tomographic (CT) cross-sectional imaging and readily available software, the assessment of skeletal muscle mass to evaluate sarcopenia has become simplified. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the prognostic value of skeletal muscle index (SMI) obtained from cross-sectional CT imaging on clinical outcomes in non-haematologic solid tumours. Methods We searched PubMed and the American Society Clinical Oncology online database of meeting abstracts up to October 2015 for relevant studies. We included studies assessing the prognostic impact of pre-treatment SMI on clinical outcomes in patients with non-haematologic solid tumours. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) and the secondary outcomes~included cancer-specific survival (CSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS). The summary hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results A total of 7843 patients from 38 studies were included. SMI lower than the cut-off was associated with poor OS (HR~=~1.44, 95\% CI~=~1.32–1.56, p~{$<~$}0.001). The effect of SMI on OS was observed among various tumour types and across disease stages. Worse CSS was also associated with low SMI (HR~=~1.93, 95\% CI~=~1.38–2.70, p~{$<~$}0.001) as well as DFS (HR~=~1.16, 95\% CI = 1.00–1.30, p~=~0.014), but not PFS (HR~=~1.54, 95\% CI~=~0.90–2.64, p~=~0.117). Conclusions This meta-analysis demonstrates that low SMI at cancer diagnosis is associated with worse survival in patients with solid tumours. Further research into understanding and mitigating the negative effects of sarcopenia in adults with cancer is needed.},

In particular, individual-level causal inference has important applications such as precision medicine. We give a new theoretical analysis and family of algorithms for predicting individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data, under the assumption known as strong ignorability. The algorithms learn a "balanced" representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look similar. We give a novel, simple and intuitive generalization-error bound showing that the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances. Experiments on real and simulated data show the new algorithms match or outperform the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {Diabetes, obesity and hypertension are common conditions and their concurrence is more common than would have been expected: 15\% of the developed world suffer from the triad of "diabesotension". The pathophysiology involves characteristic neurohormonal profiles that collectively suggest the consideration of diabesotension as a distinct clinical entity. Diabesotensive patients have double the risk of suffering from the micro and macrovascular complications of each of the conditions alone. Therefore, it is critical to reduce their overall risk and provide them with special attention. Studies have shown that the number needed to treat in diabesotension is lower compared to non-obese. Appropriate treatment goals should be set. With regards to hypertension, recent clinical trials point to 130-135/80-85\&\#x2009;mmHg. Lifestyle modifications are critical, therefore DASH and Mediterranean diet should be recommended along with a physical training program. Weight reduction strategies often fail and bariatric surgery should be considered. All antihypertensive drug-classes are adequate to treat uncomplicated diabesotension and it is not mandatory to include RAAS blockers as first-line therapy. However, as second line, for high risk patients and patients with nephropathy - a RAAS blocker is indicated. Combination therapy is almost always prescribed in the course of the disease. In the absence of compelling indications, a RAAS blocker with a calcium-channels blocker is preferred as it provides benefits beyond blood pressure control. Resistant hypertension is common, and secondary causes should be looked for, particularly sleep apnea. A novel procedure such as renal denervation is a promising option due to its antihypertensive and metabolic benefits. Copyright \&\#xA9; 2012 John Wiley \&amp; Sons, Ltd.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the use of neural networks for the estimation of treatment effects from observational data. Generally, estimation proceeds in two stages. First, we fit models for the expected outcome and the probability of treatment (propensity score) for each unit. Second, we plug these fitted models into a downstream estimator of the effect. Neural networks are a natural choice for the models in the first step. The question we address is: how can we adapt the design and training of the neural networks used in the first step in order to improve the quality of the final estimate of the treatment effect? We propose two adaptations based on insights from the statistical literature on the estimation of treatment effects. The first is a new architecture, the Dragonnet, that exploits the sufficiency of the propensity score for estimation adjustment. The second is a regularization procedure, targeted regularization, that induces a bias towards models that have non-parametrically optimal asymptotic properties `out-of-the-box`. Studies on benchmark datasets for causal inference show these adaptations outperform existing methods. Code is available at github.com/claudiashi57/dragonnet.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia influences overall survival (OS) and tumor progression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the impact of postoperative  complications and the outcome of limited surgery have not been highlighted.  Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia  on surgical outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included NSCLC patients who  had undergone lung cancer resection between 2007 and 2017. Sarcopenia was confirmed  based on computed tomography of the cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the  third lumbar vertebra level. We used propensity score-matched analysis to elucidate  the impact of sarcopenia on postoperative complications and limited surgery.  RESULTS: A total of 391 patients were enrolled, including 198 sarcopenic patients.  Multivariate analysis showed that sarcopenia was an independent unfavorable  prognostic factor associated with OS and recurrence-free survival [hazard ratio  (HR), 3.33, P\,{$<$}\,0.001; HR, 2.76, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, respectively]. Regarding the incidence  of postoperative complications, there was no difference between sarcopenic and  nonsarcopenic patients (69/198 versus 55/193, P\,=\,0.19). After propensity score  matching, among patients without sarcopenia, the 5-year OS was lower in those with  limited surgery than in those with standard surgery (70.7\% vs. 96.4\%, P\,=\,0.011). In  contrast, among sarcopenic patients, there was no difference in the 5-year OS  between patients with limited surgery and those with standard surgery (53.2\% vs.  60.7\%, P\,=\,0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is a prognostic predictor for poor OS and  may contribute to the selection of limited surgery for sarcopenic patients.  Preoperative assessment of sarcopenia may provide clinically important information.},

  abstract = {Background: Although the skeletal muscle in the region of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) is generally assessed in order to judge sarcopenia, not every patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoes computed tomography including the L3 region. We hypothesized that immuno-nutritional parameters could predict the existence of sarcopenia in patients with NSCLC. Aim: The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the correlation between preoperative sarcopenia and immuno-nutritional parameters in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Patients and Methods: We selected 147 of patients with pathological stage I NSCLC who underwent preoperative measurement of immuno-nutritional parameters and CT including the L3 region. Results: Preoperative sarcopenia was significantly associated with female gender (p=0.0003) and poor prognosis (p=0.0322). In Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) by preoperative sarcopenia status, the sarcopenic group had significantly shorter OS than the non-sarcopenic group (5-year OS: 87.27\% vs. 77.37\%, p=0.0131, log-rank test). In multivariate analysis, the preoperative sarcopenia status (hazard ratio=5.138; 95\% confidence interval=2.305-11.676; p{$<$}0.0001) was an independent prognostic factor. Preoperative sarcopenia status was significantly related to controlling nutritional status score (p=0.0071) and Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) (p{$<$}0.0001). Spearman's correlation test showed good significant correlation between preoperative sarcopenia status and GNRI (r=0.348, p{$<$}0.0001). Conclusion: The preoperative GNRI is a simple and useful predictor for existence of preoperative sarcopenia which was associated with poor outcome in patients with early-stage NSCLC. © 2017 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Treatment of technically operable, medically fit locoregionally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is a controversial therapeutic  challenge. Our group routinely uses a trimodality approach. Recent advances in  radiotherapy allow for improved tumor targeting and daily patient positioning. We  hypothesized that these technologies would improve pathologic response rates. We  analyzed consecutively treated stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC patients undergoing  chemoradiotherapy before major lung resection, with particular attention paid to the  impact of advanced technologies. METHODS: Locoregionally advanced NSCLC patients  (N2) staged in a multidisciplinary forum with mediastinoscopy were planned to  receive platinum-based chemotherapy and 60Gy and major lung resection.  Four-dimensional CT (4DCT) and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) were used as  available. Survival endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and  compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox  proportional hazards models. RESULTS: We identified 53 patients from 2/1999 to  2/2010. Median RT dose was 59Gy. 68\% underwent lobectomy. Forty-three patients were  downstaged pathologically (81\%), 38 experienced mediastinal sterilization (72\%), and  21 (40\%) had complete pathologic response (pCR). 1 and 2 year OS were 85.5\% and  61.6\%. Superior OS and DFS were associated with nodal downstaging and mediastinal  sterilization (pN0). Treatment with IGRT/4DCT in 10 patients resulted in high rates  of nodal downstaging (100\% vs 77\%, p=0.0452), mediastinal sterilization (90\% vs 67\%,  p=0.0769), and pCR (60\% vs 35\%, p=0.0728). CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients,  definitive dose CRT followed by major lung resection results in promising DFS and  OS. The use of advanced radiotherapy techniques (4DCT and IGRT) appears to result in  promising pathologic response rates.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To review our experience using conformal treatment planning and high-dose radiotherapy for Stage IIIa and IIIb nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to  identify a subset of patients best suited for this approach by analyzing multiple  pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between  December 1987 and June 1992, 37 patients with Stage III NSCLC treated with high-dose  radiotherapy using conformal radiotherapy were reviewed. The patient characteristics  were as follows: Stage IIIa (18 patients), IIIb [19]; T1-2 [13], T3-4 [24]; N0-1  [8], N2-3 [29]; and median age 63. All patients were treated with 1.8-2.0 Gy  fractions to a median dose of 66 Gy (range 60-70 Gy). Outcome was analyzed by  multiple pretreatment variables including age, sex, Karnofsky performance score,  pretreatment symptoms, stage group, T and N stage, tumor volume (calculated from  computed tomography (CT) contours), presence of atelectasis, and tumor histology.  Outcome was also analyzed by total radiotherapy dose. RESULTS: The median, 1-year  and 2-year survival rates for the entire group were 19.5 months, 75 and 37\%,  respectively. The median, 1-year, and 2-year local progression-free survival rates  are 15.6 months, 62 and 23\%. There was no difference in survival by stage group  (IIIa vs. IIIb) or by T or N stage. Tumor volumes ranged from 47-511 cc in the  patients without atelectasis and were not a significant prognostic factor. Histology  was found to be a significant prognostic factor, with squamous cell carcinoma having  a better overall survival and local progression-free survival than other  histologies. No other patient characteristic was found to be significant by either  univariate or multivariate analysis. When outcome was analyzed by radiotherapy dose,  no dose response was evident in the narrow dose range studied (60-70 Gy). Toxicity  included two cases of pneumonitis, which resolved with conservative therapy.  CONCLUSION: High-dose conformal radiotherapy, in our experience, results in overall  survival rates that compare favorably with trials of chemoradiotherapy or  conventional radiotherapy with a low treatment-associated morbidity. However, local  progression remains a significant problem despite median radiotherapy doses of 66  Gy. Future trials using escalating radiotherapy doses with conformal radiotherapy  are therefore, indicated.},

Depending on the frequency and severity of their attacks, patients with PMM will likely need an acute treatment and/or short-term preventive plan. Of note, with the use of acute treatments and short-term preventive therapy there is risk of medication overuse if the patient does have pure menstrual migraine and is being treated for menstrually related migraine. AREAS COVERED: A PubMed, Cochrane Central, Medline, Ovid search provided articles relating to menstrual migraine pathophysiology and treatment. EXPERT OPINION: Long-term daily preventive treatment should be considered for patients with MRM and those with severe PMM. Miniprophylaxis can be used in PMM rather than daily preventive treatment. When considering the use of short-term miniprophylaxis, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, and frovatriptan have shown efficacy; however, frovatriptan appears to be the triptan of choice based on overall efficacy. Oral contraceptives may be considered if patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate typical migraine preventive medications. In patients with migraine with aura, oral contraceptives should be used with caution as this may add to the risk of stroke in this population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Menstrually associated migraine (MAM) is often prolonged and difficult to manage with conventional therapies. Frovatriptan is a new selective 5HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist indicated for short-term management of migraine. It has a long half-life and good tolerability. These characteristics suggest that frovatriptan may be useful for the intermittent prevention of MAM. METHODS: The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design. Patients treated each of three perimenstrual periods (PMPs) with placebo, frovatriptan 2.5 mg QD, and frovatriptan 2.5 mg BID. The 6-day treatment started 2 days before the anticipated start of MAM headache. The primary efficacy endpoint was incidence of MAM headache during the 6-day PMP. RESULTS: The population comprised 546 women (mean age, 37.6 years). Use of frovatriptan reduced the occurrence of MAM headache. The incidence of MAM headache during the 6-day PMP was 67\% for placebo, 52\% for frovatriptan 2.5 mg QD, and 41\% for frovatriptan 2.5 mg BID. Both frovatriptan regimens were superior to placebo (p {$<$} 0.0001), and the BID regimen was superior to the QD regimen (p {$<$} 0.001). Both frovatriptan regimens also reduced MAM severity (p {$<$} 0.0001), duration (p {$<$} 0.0001), and the use of rescue medication (p {$<$} 0.01 QD; p {$<$} 0.0001 BID) in a dose-dependent manner. The incidence and type of adverse events for both regimens were similar to placebo and consistent with those reported for short-term migraine management. CONCLUSION: Frovatriptan given prophylactically for 6 days was effective in reducing the incidence of menstrually associated migraine. More than half of patients who used frovatriptan 2.5 mg BID had no menstrually associated migraine headache during the 6-day perimenstrual period. The findings are consistent with the long duration of action and good tolerability of frovatriptan observed in short-term migraine management.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have been widely used as a representation of conditional independence in machine learning and statistics. Moreover, hidden or latent variables are often an important component of graphical models. However, DAG models suffer from an important limitation: the family of DAGs is not closed under marginalization of hidden variables. This means that in general we cannot use a DAG to represent the independencies over a subset of variables in a larger DAG. Directed mixed graphs (DMGs) are a representation that includes DAGs as a special case, and overcomes this limitation. This paper introduces algorithms for performing Bayesian inference in Gaussian and probit DMG models. An important requirement for inference is the specification of the distribution over parameters of the models. We introduce a new distribution for covariance matrices of Gaussian DMGs. We discuss and illustrate how several Bayesian machine learning tasks can benefit from the principle presented here: the power to model dependencies that are generated from hidden variables, but without necessarily modeling such variables explicitly.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In patients with advanced incurable lung cancer deciding as to the most appropriate treatment (e.g., chemotherapy or supportive care only) is challenging. In such patients the TNM classification system has reached its ceiling therefore other factors are used to assess prognosis and as such, guide treatment. Performance status (PS), weight loss and inflammatory biomarkers (Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS)) predict survival in advanced lung cancer however these have not been compared. This study compares key prognostic factors in advanced lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer were recruited and demographics, weight loss, other prognostic factors (mGPS, PS) were collected. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to compare these prognostic factors. RESULTS: 390 patients with advanced incurable lung cancer were recruited; 341 were male, median age was 66 years (IQR 59-73) and patients had stage IV non-small cell (n=288) (73.8\%) or extensive stage small cell lung cancer (n=102) (26.2\%). The median survival was 7.8 months. On multivariate analysis only performance status (HR 1.74 CI 1.50-2.02) and mGPS (HR 1.67, CI 1.40-2.00) predicted survival (p{$<$}0.001). Survival at 3 months ranged from 99\% (ECOG 0-1) to 74\% (ECOG 2) and using mGPS, from 99\% (mGPS0) to 71\% (mGPS2). In combination, survival ranged from 99\% (mGPS 0, ECOG 0-1) to 33\% (mGPS2, ECOG 3). CONCLUSION: Performance status and the mGPS are superior prognostic factors in advanced lung cancer. In combination, these improved survival prediction compared with either alone.},

Minimal data are available from adequately powered randomized, controlled trials. METHODS: We randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio to receive convalescent plasma or placebo. The primary outcome was the patient's clinical status 30 days after the intervention, as measured on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from total recovery to death. RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were assigned to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo. The median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in the trial was 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10), and hypoxemia was the most frequent severity criterion for enrollment. The infused convalescent plasma had a median titer of 1:3200 of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 to 1:3200). No patients were lost to follow-up. At day 30 day, no significant difference was noted between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the distribution of clinical outcomes according to the ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.35; P\,=\,0.46). Overall mortality was 10.96\% in the convalescent plasma group and 11.43\% in the placebo group, for a risk difference of -0.46 percentage points (95\% CI, -7.8 to 6.8). Total SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers tended to be higher in the convalescent plasma group at day 2 after the intervention. Adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.

  abstract = {Background: Patients with myeloma who relapse after high-dose chemotherapy have few therapeutic options. Since increased bone marrow vascularity imparts a poor prognosis in myeloma, we evaluated the efficacy of thalidomide, which has antiangiogenic properties, in patients with refractory disease. Methods: Eighty-four previously treated patients with refractory myeloma (76 with a relapse after high-dose chemotherapy) received oral thalidomide as a single agent for a median of 80 days (range, 2 to 465). The starting dose was 200 mg daily, and the dose was increased by 200 mg every two weeks until it reached 800 mg per day. Response was assessed on the basis of a reduction of the myeloma protein in serum or Bence Jones protein in urine that lasted for at least six weeks. Results: The serum or urine levels of paraprotein were reduced by at least 90 percent in eight patients (two had a complete remission), at least 75 percent in six patients, at least 50 percent in seven patients, and at least 25 percent in six patients, for a total rate of response of 32 percent. Reductions in the paraprotein levels were apparent within two months in 78 percent of the patients with a response and were associated with decreased numbers of plasma cells in bone marrow and increased hemoglobin levels. The microvascular density of bone marrow did not change significantly in patients with a response. At least one third of the patients had mild or moderate constipation, weakness or fatigue, or somnolence. More severe adverse effects were infrequent (occurring in less than 10 percent of patients), and hematologic effects were rare. As of the most recent follow-up, 36 patients had died (30 with no response and 6 with a response). After 12 months of follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the mean (±SE) rates of event-free survival and overall survival for all patients were 22±5 percent and 58±5 percent, respectively. Conclusions: Thalidomide is active against advanced myeloma. It can induce marked and durable responses in some patients with multiple myeloma, including those who relapse after high-dose chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background \&amp; aims Recent research indicates that severe muscular depletion (sarcopenia) is frequent in cancer patients and linked to cachexia and poor survival. Our aim was to investigate if measures of skeletal muscle hold prognostic information in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods We included NSCLC patients with disease stage IIIB/IV, performance status 0–2, enrolled in three randomised trials of first-line chemotherapy (n = 1305). Computed tomography (CT) images obtained before start of treatment were used for body composition analyses at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Skeletal muscle mass was assessed by measures of the cross sectional muscle area, from which the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was obtained. Skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) was measured as the mean Hounsfield unit (HU) of the measured muscle area. A high level of mean HU indicates a high SMD. Results Complete data were available for 734 patients, mean age 65 years. Both skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle radiodensity (SMD) varied largely. Mean SMI and SMD were 47.7 cm2/m2 and 37.4 HU in men (n = 420), 39.6 cm2/m2 and 37.0 HU in women (n = 314). Multivariable Cox regression analyses, adjusted for established prognostic factors, showed that SMD was independently prognostic for survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95\% CI 0.97–0.99, p = 0.001), whereas SMI was not (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.98–1.01, p = 0.329). Conclusion Low SMD is associated with poorer survival in advanced NSCLC. Further research is warranted to establish whether muscle measures should be integrated into routine practice to improve prognostic accuracy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism},

  abstract = {New Findings * What is the topic of this review? This review concerns the history of baroreflex control of blood pressure in animals and man. It deals mainly with mechanisms at a subcortical level and so complements the earlier review by Coote (). * What advances does it highlight? New studies now confirm that the arterial baroreflex does control long-term level of blood pressure through mechanisms which involve electrolyte and water excretion via nervous control of the kidney. The review also describes recent data on human blood pressure control using implanted devices to unilaterally stimulate the carotid baroreceptors, effective over several years with minimal complications. Music therapy is also discussed. Although drug treatment of human hypertension has greatly improved, there is renewed interest in non-drug methods of blood pressure reduction. Animal experiments have now shown that arterial baroreflexes do control long-term blood pressure levels, particularly by nervously mediated renal excretion of sodium and water. This Paton Lecture provides a review of the historical development of knowledge of peripheral circulatory control in order to supplement prior Paton Lectures concerned with cerebral cortical and other areas of influence. I also discuss how improved understanding of nervous control of the circulation has led to current methods of non-drug blood pressure control in man by implanted carotid baroreceptor pacemakers or by renal denervation. Finally, the role of other therapy, particularly listening to music, is reviewed.},

  abstract = {The C statistic is a commonly reported measure of screening test performance. Optimistic estimation of the C statistic is a frequent problem because of overfitting of statistical models in small data sets, and methods exist to correct for this issue. However, many studies do not use such methods, and those that do correct for optimism use diverse methods, some of which are known to be biased. We used clinical data sets (United Kingdom Down syndrome screening data from Glasgow (1991–2003), Edinburgh (1999–2003), and Cambridge (1990–2006), as well as Scottish national pregnancy discharge data (2004–2007)) to evaluate different approaches to adjustment for optimism. We found that sample splitting, cross-validation without replication, and leave-1-out cross-validation produced optimism-adjusted estimates of the C statistic that were biased and/or associated with greater absolute error than other available methods. Cross-validation with replication, bootstrapping, and a new method (leave-pair-out cross-validation) all generated unbiased optimism-adjusted estimates of the C statistic and had similar absolute errors in the clinical data set. Larger simulation studies confirmed that all 3 methods performed similarly with 10 or more events per variable, or when the C statistic was 0.9 or greater. However, with lower events per variable or lower C statistics, bootstrapping tended to be optimistic but with lower absolute and mean squared errors than both methods of cross-validation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background             Corticosteroids could improve outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, we hypothesize that corticosteroid effectiveness varies among individual patients, resulting in inconsistent outcomes and unclear clinical indication. Therefore, we developed and validated a predictive, causal model based on baseline characteristics to predict individualized treatment effects (ITEs) of corticosteroids on mortality in patients with CAP.                                   Methods             We obtained individual patient data from six randomized controlled trials comparing corticosteroid therapy to placebo in 1,869 adult CAP patients. The study endpoint was 30-day mortality. We performed effect modelling through logistic regression and evaluated the predicted ITEs in terms of discrimination and calibration for benefit. Our modelling procedure involved variable selection, missing value imputation, data normalization, encoding treatment variables, creating interaction terms, optimizing penalization strength, and training logistic regression models. We evaluated discriminative performance using the newly proposed ‘AUC-benefit’.                                   Findings             The model identified high levels of CRP and glucose, at baseline, as main predictors for benefit of corticosteroid treatment. Using a decision threshold of ITE=0, the model predicted harm in 1,004 patient and benefit in 864 patients. We observed benefit in patients where the model predicted benefit, with an odds ratio of 0.5 (95\% CI: 0.3 to 0.9) and a mortality reduction of 3.2\% (95\% CI: 0.7 to 5.6), and no statistically significant benefit in the patients where the model predicted harm, with an odds ratio of 1.1 (95\% CI: 0.7 to 1.8) and a negative mortality reduction (hence, increase) of −0.3\% (95\% CI: −2.6 to 1.8). The model yielded an AUC-benefit of 184.9 (28.6 to 347.6, 95\% CI), underestimated ITEs in the lower ITE region and slightly overestimated ITEs in the higher ITE region.                                   Interpretation             Our model has potential to identify patients with CAP who benefit from corticosteroid treatment, and aid in the design of personalized clinical trials. We will prospectively validate the model in two recent CAP trials.},

Contemporaneously National Health Service (NHS) Wales introduced Quality and Outcomes Framework payments to general practices to focus care on those at highest risk of emergency admission to hospital. The aim of this study was to evaluate the costs and effects of introducing PRISM into primary care. METHODS: Randomised stepped wedge trial with 32 general practices in one Welsh health board. The intervention comprised: PRISM software; practice-based training; clinical support through two 'general practitioner (GP) champions' and technical support. The primary outcome was emergency hospital admissions. RESULTS: Across 230 099 participants, PRISM implementation increased use of health services: emergency hospital admission rates by 1 \% when untransformed (while change in log-transformed rate ΔL=0.011, 95\% CI 0.010 to 0.013); emergency department (ED) attendance rates by untransformed 3 \% (while ΔL=0.030, 95\% CI 0.028 to 0.032); outpatient visit rates by untransformed 5 \% (while ΔL=0.055, 95\% CI 0.051 to 0.058); the proportion of days with recorded GP activity by untransformed 1 \% (while ΔL=0.011, 95\% CI 0.007 to 0.014) and time in hospital by untransformed 3 \% (while ΔL=0.029, 95\% CI 0.026 to 0.031). Thus NHS costs per participant increased by £76 (95\% CI £46 to £106). CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of PRISM resulted in a statistically significant increase in emergency hospital admissions and use of other NHS services without evidence of benefits to patients or the NHS.},

Intravenous infusion of propranolol, a drug which prevents renin release, at 1 mg/kg for 70 minutes beginning at time of pedicle clamping resulted in significantly lower serum creatinine in this model (2.8 +/- 0.2 mg\% at 48 hours with propranolol versus 5.2 +/- 0.8 mg\% without). Renin stimulation by dehydration or feeding a low-salt diet enhanced the difference between treated and untreated groups (2.6 +/- 0.4 mg\% with propranolol versus 6.2 +/- 1.8 mg\% without, after dehydration; 3.5 +/- 1.0 mg\% with propranolol versus 7.6 +/- 1.4 mg\% without, after low-salt diet).Suppression of renin production by saline feeding eliminated propranolol's beneficial effect (5.6 +/- 0.9 mg\% with propranolol versus 4.0 +/- 0.6 mg\% without). In rabbits with a normal food and water intake, renal denervation using phenol also eliminated propranolol's effect (creatinine 8.6 +/- 1.4 mg\% with propranolol versus 8.6 +/- 1.8 mg\% without). In rabbits with intact kidneys, flow probe recording of renal blood flow showed a significantly higher blood flow immediately after unclamping in the propranolol-treated animals, and renal angiograms showed less vasoconstriction in this group after unclamping. In this model of acute renal failure, renal vasoconstriction plays an important role following the initial ischemic insult. Propranolol lessens the severity of this vasoconstriction and the resulting acute renal failure. Its probable action is interference with neurogenically stimulated renin release.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to determine whether metabolic volume-based measurements on FDG PET/CT scans could provide additional information for predicting outcome in patients  with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with induction  chemotherapy. METHODS: Included in the study were 32 patients with stage III NSCLC  who were treated with induction platinum-based chemotherapy followed in 21 by  surgery. All patients had an FDG PET/CT scan before and after the induction  chemotherapy. Tumours were delineated using adaptive threshold methods. The SUVmax,  SUVpeak, SUVmean, tumour volume (TV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and volume and  largest diameter on the CT images (CTV and CTD, respectively) were calculated. Index  ratios of the primary tumour were calculated by dividing the follow-up measurements  by the baseline measurements. The prognostic value of each parameter for event-free  survival (EFS) was determined using Cox regression models. RESULTS: The median  follow-up time was 19 months (range 6-43 months). Baseline PET and CT parameters  were not significant prognostic factors. After induction therapy, only SUVmax,  SUVpeak, SUVmean, TV, TLG and CTV were prognostic factors for EFS, in contrast to  CTD. Of the index ratios, only TV and TLG ratios were prognostic factors for EFS.  Patients with a TLG ratio {$<$}0.48 had a longer EFS than those with a TLG ratio {$>$}0.48  (13.9 vs. 9.2 months, p = 0.04). After adjustment for the effect of surgical  treatment, all the parameters significantly correlated with EFS remained  significant. CONCLUSION: SUV, metabolic volume-based indices, and CTV after  induction chemotherapy give independent prognostic information in stage III NSCLC.  However, changes in metabolic TV and TLG under induction treatment provide more  accurate prognostic information than SUV alone, and CTD and CTV.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models (CPMs) are often used to guide treatment initiation, with individuals at high risk offered treatment. This implicitly assumes that the probability quoted from a CPM represents the risk to an individual of an adverse outcome in absence of treatment. However, for a CPM to correctly target this estimand requires careful causal thinking. One problem that needs to be overcome is treatment drop-in: where individuals in the development data commence treatment after the time of prediction but before the outcome occurs. In this issue of the Journal, Xu et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2021;000(00):000–000) use causal estimates from external data sources, such as clinical trials, to adjust CPMs for treatment drop-in. This represents a pragmatic and promising approach to address this issue, and it illustrates the value of utilizing causal inference in prediction. Building causality into the prediction pipeline can also bring other benefits. These include the ability to make and compare hypothetical predictions under different interventions, to make CPMs more explainable and transparent, and to improve model generalizability. Enriching CPMs with causal inference therefore has the potential to add considerable value to the role of prediction in healthcare.},

Theoretical development and application of methods for handling missing data have mostly been conducted in the context of prospective research data and with a goal of description or causal explanation. However, it is now common to build predictive models using routinely collected data, where missing patterns may convey important information, and one might take a pragmatic approach to optimizing prediction. Therefore, different methods to handle missing data may be preferred. Furthermore, an underappreciated issue in prediction modeling is that the missing data method used in model development may not match the method used when a model is deployed. This may lead to overoptimistic assessments of model performance. For prediction, particularly with routinely collected data, methods for handling missing data that incorporate information within the missingness pattern should be explored and further developed. Where missing data methods differ between model development and model deployment, the implications of this must be explicitly evaluated. The trade-off between building a prediction model that is causally principled, and building a prediction model that maximizes the use of all available information, should be carefully considered and will depend on the intended use of the model.},

No cut-off values of vessel diameter were used. All patients were successfully treated with no intra- or postprocedural complications, and all showed 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure reduction at the 12-month follow-up. Percutaneous renal denervation is a feasible approach for end-stage renal disease patients with resistant hypertension with encouraging short-term preliminary results in terms of procedural efficacy and safety.}

  abstract = {In longitudinal observational studies, marginal structural models (MSMs) are a class of causal models used to analyze the effect of an exposure on the (survival) outcome of interest while accounting for exposure-affected time-dependent confounding. In the applied literature, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) has been widely adopted to estimate MSMs. An essential assumption for IPTW-based MSMs is the positivity assumption, which ensures that each individual in the population has a non-zero probability of receiving each exposure level within confounder strata. Positivity, along with consistency, conditional exchangeability, and correct specification of the weighting model, is crucial for valid causal inference through IPTW-based MSMs but is often overlooked compared to confounding bias. Positivity violations can arise from subjects having a zero probability of being exposed/unexposed (strict violations) or near-zero probabilities due to sampling variability (near violations). This article discusses the effect of violations in the positivity assumption on the estimates from IPTW-based MSMs. Building on the algorithms for simulating longitudinal survival data from MSMs by Havercroft and Didelez (2012) and Keogh et al. (2021), systematic simulations under strict/near positivity violations are performed. Various scenarios are explored by varying (i) the size of the confounder interval in which positivity violations arise, (ii) the sample size, (iii) the weight truncation strategy, and (iv) the subject's propensity to follow the protocol violation rule. This study underscores the importance of assessing positivity violations in IPTW-based MSMs to ensure robust and reliable causal inference in survival analyses.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Cancer cachexia and sarcopenia are frequently observed in cancer patients and associated with poor survival. The majority of studies of cancer cachexia and sarcopenia have been done in patients with solid tumors of different origins, and there are currently no good predictors of the benefit of chemotherapy or factors that predict survival in advanced cancer. The purpose of our prospective study was to evaluate prevalence of cachexia and sarcopenia using international consensus definition and criteria for diagnosis in patients with diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage IIIB and IV and their relation to chemotherapy toxicity and survival prediction. A secondary aim was to compare several biochemical markers (CRP, IL-6, protein, and albumin) with time to tumor progression in order to assess prognostic value or to guide a treatment. Methods: Between December 2013 and April 2015, the prospective cohort study of 100 Caucasian patients with advanced NSCLC stage IIIB or IV, who were referred consecutively to Department for Respiratory Diseases “Jordanovac,” was evaluated. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical data (CRP, albumin, protein, IL-6, haemoglobin) together with body composition measurements (total muscle cross-sectional area, lumbar skeletal muscle index) were obtained for each patient before starting with platinum-doublet therapy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebra was measured by computerized tomography, and sarcopenia was defined using a previously published cutoff point. Toxicity was assessed after cycle 1 of treatment and time-to-tumor progression was determined prospectively. Results: One hundred patients with advanced lung cancer were recruited: 67 were male and median age was 64 years. The median time to disease progression was 187 days. The prevalence of cachexia and sarcopenia in study cohort was 69 and 47 \%, respectively. CRP, IL-6, and albumin concentration in cachectic compared to non-cachectic patients demonstrated statistically significant difference (p = 0.020, p = 0.040, p = 0.003). Cachexia and sarcopenia were not found to be predictors of chemotoxicity nor was time to tumor progression. On the contrary, albumin concentration with established cutoff point of 37.5 g/L was clearly proved as the predictive factor of both chemotoxicity (OR (95 \% CI) = 0.85; p {$<$} 0.001) and survival (HR (95 \% CI) = 0.55). Conclusions: Albumin level has been shown to be more important predictive marker of chemotherapy toxicity and survival than cachexia and sarcopenia are. This approach in clinical settings can be used to guide the choice of oncologic treatment. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

To help bridge the two worlds, we provide an introduction to current problems and techniques in pharmacometrics that ranges from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling to pharmacometric simulations, model-informed precision dosing, and systems pharmacology, and review some of the machine learning approaches to address them.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Robust, automated segmentation algorithms are required for quantitative analysis of large imaging datasets. We developed an automated method that identifies and labels brain tumor–associated pathology by using an iterative probabilistic voxel labeling using k-nearest neighbor and Gaussian mixture model classification. Our purpose was to develop a segmentation method which could be applied to a variety of imaging from The Cancer Imaging Archive. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images from 2 sets of 15 randomly selected subjects with glioblastoma from The Cancer Imaging Archive were processed by using the automated algorithm. The algorithm-defined tumor volumes were compared with those segmented by trained operators by using the Dice similarity coefficient. RESULTS: Compared with operator volumes, algorithm-generated segmentations yielded mean Dice similarities of 0.92 ± 0.03 for contrast-enhancing volumes and 0.84 ± 0.09 for FLAIR hyperintensity volumes. These values compared favorably with the means of Dice similarity coefficients between the operator-defined segmentations: 0.92 ± 0.03 for contrast-enhancing volumes and 0.92 ± 0.05 for FLAIR hyperintensity volumes. Robust segmentations can be achieved when only postcontrast T1WI and FLAIR images are available. CONCLUSIONS: Iterative probabilistic voxel labeling defined tumor volumes that were highly consistent with operator-defined volumes. Application of this algorithm could facilitate quantitative assessment of neuroimaging from patients with glioblastoma for both research and clinical indications.},

  abstract = {Background. Sarcopenia is a defining feature of cancer cachexia associated with physical decline, poor quality of life and poor prognosis. Thus, maintaining muscle mass is an important aim of cachexia treatment. Many patients at risk for developing cachexia or with cachexia experience side effects of chemotherapy that might aggravate the development of cachexia. However, achieving tumor control might reverse the catabolic processes causing cachexia. There is limited knowledge about muscle mass changes during chemotherapy or whether changes in muscle mass are associated with response to chemotherapy. Patients and methods. In this pilot study, patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving three courses of palliative chemotherapy were analyzed. Muscle mass was measured as skeletal muscle cross sectional area (SMCA) at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae using CT images taken before and after chemotherapy. Results. In total 35 patients, 48\% women, mean age 67 years (range 56-86), participated; 83\% had stage IV disease and 71\% were sarcopenic at baseline. Mean reduction in SMCA from pre- to post-chemotherapy was 4.6 cm2 (CI 95\% -7.3–1.9; p \&lt; 0.002), corresponding to a 1.4 kg loss of whole body muscle mass. Sixteen patients remained stable or gained SMCA. Of these, 14 (56\%) responded to chemotherapy, while two progressed (p = 0.071). Maintaining or gaining SMCA resulted in longer median overall survival (loss: 5.8 months, stable/gain: 10.7 months; p = 0.073). Stage of disease (p = 0.003), treatment regimen (p = 0.023), response to chemotherapy (p = 0.007) and SMCA change (p = 0.040), but not sarcopenia at baseline, were significant prognostic factors in the multivariate survival analyses. Conclusion. Almost half of the patients had stable or increased muscle mass during chemotherapy without receiving any cachexia treatment. Nearly all of these patients responded to the chemotherapy. Increase in muscle mass, but not sarcopenia at baseline, was a significant prognostic factor. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.},

  abstract = {Purpose An increasing serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is the initial sign of recurrent prostate cancer among patients treated with radical prostatectomy. Salvage radiation therapy (SRT) may eradicate locally recurrent cancer, but studies to distinguish local from systemic recurrence lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. We developed a nomogram to predict the probability of cancer control at 6 years after SRT for PSA-defined recurrence. Patients and Methods Using multivariable Cox regression analysis, we constructed a model to predict the probability of disease progression after SRT in a multi-institutional cohort of 1,540 patients. Results The 6-year progression-free probability was 32\% (95\% CI, 28\% to 35\%) overall. Forty-eight percent (95\% CI, 40\% to 56\%) of patients treated with SRT alone at PSA levels of 0.50 ng/mL or lower were disease free at 6 years, including 41\% (95\% CI, 31\% to 51\%) who also had a PSA doubling time of 10 months or less or poorly differentiated (Gleason grade 8 to 10) cancer. Significant variables in the model were PSA level before SRT (P {$<$} .001), prostatectomy Gleason grade (P {$<$} .001), PSA doubling time (P {$<$} .001), surgical margins (P {$<$} .001), androgen-deprivation therapy before or during SRT (P {$<$} .001), and lymph node metastasis (P = .019). The resultant nomogram was internally validated and had a concordance index of 0.69. Conclusion Nearly half of patients with recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy have a long-term PSA response to SRT when treatment is administered at the earliest sign of recurrence. The nomogram we developed predicts the outcome of SRT and should prove valuable for medical decision making for patients with a rising PSA level.},

We evaluated standard error, precision (inverse of standard error), variance, inverse of variance, sample size and log sample size (vertical axis) and log odds ratio, log risk ratio and risk difference (horizontal axis). Standard error is likely to be the best choice for the vertical axis: the expected shape in the absence of bias corresponds to a symmetrical funnel, straight lines to indicate 95\% confidence intervals can be included and the plot emphasises smaller studies which are more prone to bias. Precision or inverse of variance is useful when comparing meta-analyses of small trials with subsequent large trials. The use of sample size or log sample size is problematic because the expected shape of the plot in the absence of bias is unpredictable. We found similar evidence for asymmetry and between trial variation in a sample of 78 published meta-analyses whether odds ratios or risk ratios were used on the horizontal axis. Different conclusions were reached for risk differences and this was related to increased between-trial variation. We conclude that funnel plots of meta-analyses should generally use standard error as the measure of study size and ratio measures of treatment effect.},

Quantitative analysis of cell labeling after 30 μl infusions of a large range of concentrations of TB (0.001–20.0\%) showed that: (1) as little as 0.0075 mg of TB was sufficient to label DMN cells distinctly while only 0.075 mg (or larger) doses of TB were adequate for labeling cells of the NA and the RFN, and (2) doses of 3.0 mg (or greater) labeled the maximum number of cells in the DMN, NA, and RFN. Qualitative analysis suggested that medium range doses (0.075–0.75 mg) were optimal for discerning cell size and type throughout each of these nuclei.},

Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

However, these methods consider different types of shifts and have been developed under disparate frameworks, making it difficult to theoretically analyze how solutions differ with respect to stability and accuracy. Taking a causal graphical view, we use a flexible graphical representation to express various types of dataset shifts. Given a known graph of the data generating process, we show that all invariant distributions correspond to a causal hierarchy of graphical operators, which disable the edges in the graph that are responsible for the shifts. The hierarchy provides a common theoretical underpinning for understanding when and how stability to shifts can be achieved, and in what ways stable distributions can differ. We use it to establish conditions for minimax optimal performance across environments, and derive new algorithms that find optimal stable distributions. By using this new perspective, we empirically demonstrate that that there is a tradeoff between minimax and average performance.},

This provides the ability to compare current methods and derive new algorithms that find optimal invariant distributions, all of which can be mapped to the hierarchy.

  abstract = {Background Combining radiotherapy (RT) with immuno-oncology (IO) therapy (IORT) may enhance IO-induced antitumor response. Quantitative imaging biomarkers can be used to provide prognosis, predict tumor response in a non-invasive fashion and improve patient selection for IORT. A biologically inspired CD8 T-cells-associated radiomics signature has been developed on previous cohorts. We evaluated here whether this CD8 radiomic signature is associated with lesion response, whether it may help to assess disease spatial heterogeneity for predicting outcomes of patients treated with IORT. We also evaluated differences between irradiated and non-irradiated lesions. Methods Clinical data from patients with advanced solid tumors in six independent clinical studies of IORT were investigated. Immunotherapy consisted of 4 different drugs (antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 or anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 in monotherapy). Most patients received stereotactic RT to one lesion. Irradiated and non-irradiated lesions were delineated from baseline and the first evaluation CT scans. Radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced CT images and the CD8 radiomics signature was applied. A responding lesion was defined by a decrease in lesion size of at least 30\%. Dispersion metrices of the radiomics signature were estimated to evaluate the impact of tumor heterogeneity in patient’s response. Results A total of 94 patients involving multiple lesions (100 irradiated and 189 non-irradiated lesions) were considered for a statistical interpretation. Lesions with high CD8 radiomics score at baseline were associated with significantly higher tumor response (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.63, p=0.0020). Entropy of the radiomics scores distribution on all lesions was shown to be associated with progression-free survival (HR=1.67, p=0.040), out-of-field abscopal response (AUC=0.70, p=0.014) and overall survival (HR=2.08, p=0.023), which remained significant in a multivariate analysis including clinical and biological variables. Conclusions These results enhance the predictive value of the biologically inspired CD8 radiomics score and suggests that tumor heterogeneity should be systematically considered in patients treated with IORT. This CD8 radiomics signature may help select patients who are most likely to benefit from IORT.},

  abstract = {Objectives Sarcopenia is characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. We aimed to investigate sarcopenia in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent complete resection, and the relationship of sarcopenia with clinicopathological factors. Methods All consecutive patients who underwent lung resection between January 2005 and December 2008 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Eligible patients were assigned to one of 2 groups according to the presence or absence of sarcopenia, as assessed by the sum of cross-sectional areas of skeletal muscles in the region of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) on preoperative computed tomography (CT). Results Sixteen of 52 male (30.8\%) and 22 of 38 female (57.9\%) patients were identified with sarcopenia (p = 0.01). Patients with sarcopenia were more likely to have a low body mass index (BMI) (p {$<$} 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with sarcopenia had a significantly worse outcome than patients without sarcopenia (5-year-survival: 72.8\% vs 85.8\%, respectively, p = 0.028). Multivariate analysis found that sarcopenia was a significant independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio: 7.09, p = 0.0008). Conclusions Sarcopenia identified on a cross-sectional CT image of the L3 level was associated with poor outcome with completely resected early-stage NSCLC. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

  abstract = {Renal sympathetic hyperactivity is seminal in the maintenance and progression of hypertension. Catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation has been shown to significantly reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension. Durability of effect beyond 1 year using this novel technique has never been reported. A cohort of 45 patients with resistant hypertension (systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg on ≥3 antihypertension drugs, including a diuretic) has been originally published. Herein, we report longer-term follow-up data on these and a larger group of similar patients subsequently treated with catheter-based renal denervation in a nonrandomized manner. We treated 153 patients with catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation at 19 centers in Australia, Europe, and the United States. Mean age was 57±11 years, 39\% were women, 31\% were diabetic, and 22\% had coronary artery disease. Baseline values included mean office BP of 176/98±17/15 mm Hg, mean of 5 antihypertension medications, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 83±20 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). The median time from first to last radiofrequency energy ablation was 38 minutes. The procedure was without complication in 97\% of patients (149 of 153). The 4 acute procedural complications included 3 groin pseudoaneurysms and 1 renal artery dissection, all managed without further sequelae. Postprocedure office BPs were reduced by 20/10, 24/11, 25/11, 23/11, 26/14, and 32/14 mm Hg at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. In conclusion, in patients with resistant hypertension, catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation results in a substantial reduction in BP sustained out to ≥2 years of follow-up, without significant adverse events.},

In the presence of confounding, regression models are fitted, and results are often summarised as hazard ratios. However, despite their broad use, hazard ratios are frequently misinterpreted as relative risks instead of relative rates.                                         Methods               We discuss measures for summarising the analysis from a regression model that overcome some of the limitations associated with hazard ratios. Such measures are the standardised survival probabilities for treated and untreated: survival probabilities if everyone in the population received treatment and if everyone did not. The difference between treatment arms can be calculated to provide a measure for the treatment effect.                                         Results               Using publicly available data on breast cancer, we demonstrated the usefulness of standardised survival probabilities for comparing the experience between treated and untreated after adjusting for confounding. We also showed that additional important research questions can be addressed by standardising among subgroups of the total population.                                         Discussion               Standardised survival probabilities are a useful way to report the treatment effect while adjusting for confounding and have an informative interpretation in terms of risk.},

  abstract = {Loin pain hematuria syndrome is a rare disease with a prevalence of \&\#x223C;0.012\%. The most prominent clinical features include periods of severe intermittent or persistent unilateral or bilateral loin pain accompanied by either microscopic or gross hematuria. Patients with loin pain hematuria syndrome initially present with hematuria, flank pain, or most often both hematuria and flank pain. Kidney biopsies from patients with loin pain hematuria typically reveal only minor pathologic abnormalities. Further, loin pain hematuria syndrome is not associated with loss of kidney function or urinary tract infections. Loin pain hematuria syndrome-associated hematuria and pain are postulated to be linked to vascular disease of the kidney, coagulopathy, renal vasospasm with microinfarction, hypersensitivity, complement activation on arterioles, venocalyceal fistula, abnormal ureteral peristalsis, and intratubular deposition of calcium or uric acid microcrystals. Many patients with loin pain hematuria syndrome also meet criteria for a somatoform disorder, and analgesic medications, including narcotics, commonly are used to treat loin pain hematuria syndrome-associated pain. Interventional treatments include renal denervation, kidney autotransplantation, and nephrectomy; however, these methods should be used only as a last resort when less invasive measures have been tried unsuccessfully. In this review article, we discuss and critique current clinical practices related to loin pain hematuria syndrome pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.},

However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.},

  abstract = {To examine the association between 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and the response to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, 89 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC were retrospectively analysed. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in 18F-FDG PET/CT and the response to anti-PD-1 antibodies were recorded. A cut-off value of SUVmax was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for patient stratification. Among the 89 patients evaluated, 24 were classified as responders (all partial response), and 65 as non-responders. The average SUVmax of the responders was 15.60 (range, 6.44–51.10), which was significantly higher than that of the non-responders (11.61; range, 2.13–32.75; P\,=\,0.0168, Student’s t-test). The cut-off SUVmax value selected for stratification was 11.16 (sensitivity and specificity, 0.792 and 0.585, respectively). The response rate of patients with SUVmax value\,≥\,11.16 (41.3\% [19/46]) was significantly higher than that of patients with SUVmax\,{$<$}\,11.16 (11.6\% [5/43], P\,=\,0.0012, Chi-squared test). The SUVmax in 18F-FDG PET/CT is a potential predictive marker of response to anti-PD-1 antibody therapy in NSCLC patients. Further prospective studies of large populations are necessary to validate these results.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical impact of skeletal muscle area (SMA) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. Methods: Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on data of 103 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. The SMA was measured at the level of the third lumbar vertebral (L3) on computed tomography images using OsiriX software (32-bit, version 5.8; OsiriX, Geneva, Switzerland). The L3 muscle index (cm2/m2) was defined as the SMA (cm2) at the L3 level divided by the height (m) squared. Results: L3 muscle index Low was an independent predictor of both progression-free (P = 0.0399) and overall survival (P = 0.0155). Moreover, the disease control rate was significantly lower in the L3 muscle index Low group (49.0\% [25/51]) than in the L3 muscle index High group (73.1\% [38/52]; P = 0.0117). However, there was no significant difference between the response rates of the L3 muscle index Low group (21.6\% [11/51]) and L3 muscle index High group (32.7\% [17/52]; P = 0.2031). Conclusions: L3 muscle index Low is an independent predictor of worse outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia characterized by skeletal muscle loss may influence postoperative outcomes through physical decline and weakened immunity. We aimed to  investigate clinical significance of sarcopenia in resected early-stage non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 315 consecutive  patients with pathologic stage I NSCLC who had undergone lobectomy with systematic  nodal dissection. Sarcopenia was defined as the lowest quartile of psoas muscle area  on the 3rd vertebra on the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) image.  Clinicopathological variables were used to investigate the correlation to  postoperative complications as well as overall and recurrence-free survival.  RESULTS: Upon multivariable analysis, male sex [odds ratio (OR) =5.780, 95\%  confidence interval (CI): 2.681-12.500, P{$<$}0.001], and sarcopenia (OR =21.00, 95\% CI:  10.30-42.80, P{$<$}0.001) were independently associated with postoperative  complications. The sarcopenia group showed significantly lower 5-over all survival  (84.4\% vs. 69.1\%, P{$<$}0.001) and recurrence-free survival (77.2\% vs. 62.0\%, P{$<$}0.001)  comparing with the non-sarcopenia group. In a multivariable analysis, sarcopenia was  an independent prognostic factor [hazard ratio (HR) =1.978, 95\% CI: 1.177-3.326,  P=0.010] together with age ≥70 years (HR =1.956, 95\% CI: 1.141-3.351, P=0.015) and  non-adenocarcinoma histology (HR =1.958, 95\% CI: 1.159-3.301, P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS:  This is the first study which demonstrates that preoperative sarcopenia is  significantly associated with unfavorable postoperative complications as well as  long-term survival in pathologic stage I NSCLC. This readily available factor on  HRCT may provide valuable information to consider possible choice of surgical  procedure and perioperative management.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia, which is characterized by a decrease in muscle quantity or quality, is commonly observed in patients with cancer. Recent research has reported  contradictory results on the association between sarcopenia and the efficacy of  immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We conducted a systematic review and  meta-analysis to investigate this discrepancy. We systematically searched three  electronic databases to identify articles reporting on the association between  sarcopenia and treatment outcomes in patients with solid cancers who received ICIs.  The outcomes assessed were hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and  progression-free survival (PFS), and odds ratios (ORs) for objective response rate  (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and toxicity. Pooled estimates and their 95\%  confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 2501 patients from 26 studies  were analysed. Sarcopenia was observed in 44.7\% (95\% CI: 38.2-51.3) of the patients  and was significantly associated with poor survival (HR~=~1.55, 95\% CI~=~1.32-1.82  for OS and HR~=~1.61, 95\% CI~=~1.35 to 1.93 for PFS). The HRs (95\% CIs) for OS  according to the diagnostic measures used were 1.97 (0.88-4.41) for psoas muscle  index (PMI), 1.41 (0.87-2.28) for skeletal muscle density (SMD), and 1.43  (1.23-1.67) for skeletal mass index (SMI). The HRs (95\% CIs) for PFS were 1.86  (1.08-3.21) for PMI, 1.27 (0.94-1.71) for SMD, and 1.38 (1.11-1.71) for SMI. Poor  radiological response to ICI therapy was observed in patients with sarcopenia  (OR~=~0.52, 95\% CI~=~0.34-0.80 for ORR and OR~=~0.45, 95\% CI~=~0.30-0.67 for DCR).  The ORs for ORR (95\% CIs) were 0.56 (0.15-2.05) for PMI and 0.78 (0.56-1.09) for  SMI. The oncologic outcomes associated with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) were comparable with those observed overall (HR for OS~=~2.02, 95\%  CI~=~1.26-3.24 for melanoma and HR for OS~=~1.61, 95\% CI~=~1.19-2.18 for NSCLC). In  contrast, the occurrence of severe toxicity was not associated with sarcopenia  (OR~=~1.13, 95\% CI~=~0.51-2.52). Poor survival and poor response in patients with  sarcopenia indicate a negative association between sarcopenia and efficacy of ICIs.  Sarcopenia's predictive ability is consistent across various tumour types. For the  selection of patients who may respond to ICIs pre-therapeutically, the presence of  sarcopenia should be assessed in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Metastasis resistant to therapy is the major cause of death from cancer. Despite almost 200 years of study, the process of tumor metastasis remains controversial. Stephen Paget initially identified the role of host-tumor interactions on the basis of a review of autopsy records. His “seed and soil” hypothesis was substantiated a century later with experimental studies, and numerous reports have confirmed these seminal observations. An improved understanding of the metastatic process and the attributes of the cells selected by this process is critical for the treatment of patients with systemic disease. In many patients, metastasis has occurred by the time of diagnosis, so metastasis prevention may not be relevant. Treating systemic disease and identifying patients with early disease should be our goal. Revitalized research in the past three decades has focused on new discoveries in the biology of metastasis. Even though our understanding of molecular events that regulate metastasis has improved, the contributions and timing of molecular lesion(s) involved in metastasis pathogenesis remain unclear. Review of the history of pioneering observations and discussion of current controversies should increase understanding of the complex and multifactorial interactions between the host and selected tumor cells that contribute to fatal metastasis and should lead to the design of successful therapy.

  abstract = {Purpose To conduct a retrospective multicenter trial to determine the significance of metastatic site as a predictor of nivolumab efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Methods This study was conducted across three medical centers in Japan. We retrospectively reviewed all patients who commenced nivolumab treatment at these centers between December 17, 2015 and July 31, 2016. Clinical data were collected, including age, sex, smoking status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and metastatic site (lymph nodes, liver, brain, bone, lungs [intrapulmonary metastasis], and malignant pleural effusion) at the time of commencing nivolumab treatment. Patients were followed-up until March 31, 2017. Results Two hundred and one patients were enrolled. The median age at the time of commencing nivolumab treatment was 68 (range, 27–87) years. One hundred and thirty-five patients were male, 157 patients had a history of smoking, 153 patients had a performance status of 0–1, and 42 patients had squamous cell carcinoma. The median progression-free survival of all patients was 2.5 months. In the univariate analysis, a performance status of ≥2 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.89, 95.0\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33–2.69; p {$<$} 0.001) and liver (HR: 2.09, 95.0\% CI: 1.35–3.25; p {$<$} 0.001) and lung (HR: 1.57, 95.0\% CI: 1.14–2.16; p {$<$} 0.01) metastases correlated with a significantly shorter progression-free survival in nivolumab-treated patients. In the multivariate analysis, a performance status of ≥2 (HR: 1.54, 95.0\% CI: 1.05–2.25; p {$<$} 0.05) and liver (HR: 1.90, 95.0\% CI: 1.21–2.98; p {$<$} 0.01) and lung (HR: 1.41, 95.0\% CI: 1.00–1.99; p {$<$} 0.05) metastases were independently correlated with a significantly shorter progression-free survival in nivolumab-treated patients. Conclusion Liver and lung metastases and a poor performance status are independent predictors of nivolumab efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and is a major public health problem. Because lung cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, survival is generally poor. In recent decades, clinical advances have not led to marked improvements in outcomes. A recent advance of importance arose when the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) findings indicated that low-dose computed tomography screening of high-risk individuals can lead to a lung cancer mortality reduction of 20\%. NLST identified high-risk individuals using the following criteria: age 55 to 74 years; ≥30 pack-years of smoking; and number of years since smoking cessation ≤15 years. Medical screening is most effective when applied to high-risk individuals. The NLST criteria for high risk were practical for enrolling individuals into a clinical trial but are not optimal for risk estimation. Lung cancer risk prediction models are expected to be superior. Indeed, recently, 3 studies have provided quantitative evidence that selection of individuals for lung screening on the basis of estimates from high-quality risk prediction models is superior to using NLST criteria or similar criteria, such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria. Compared with NLST/USPSTF criteria, selection of individuals for screening using high-quality risk models should lead to fewer individuals being screened, more cancers being detected, and fewer false positives. More lives will be saved with greater cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we review methodological background for prediction modeling, existing lung cancer risk prediction models and some of their findings, and current issues in lung cancer risk prediction modeling and discuss future research.},

  abstract = {With increasing use of immunotherapy agents, pretreatment strategies for identifying responders and non-responders is useful for appropriate treatment assignment. We hypothesize that the local immune micro-environment of NSCLC is associated with patient outcomes and that these local immune features exhibit distinct radiologic characteristics discernible by quantitative imaging metrics. We assembled two cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with definitive surgical resection and extracted quantitative parameters from pretreatment CT imaging. The excised primary tumors were then quantified for percent tumor PDL1 expression and density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (via CD3 count) utilizing immunohistochemistry and automated cell counting. Associating these pretreatment radiomics parameters with tumor immune parameters, we developed an immune pathology-informed model (IPIM) that separated patients into 4 clusters (designated A-D) utilizing 4 radiomics features. The IPIM designation was significantly associated with overall survival in both training (5 year OS: 61\%, 41\%, 50\%, and 91\%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P\,=\,0.04) and validation (5 year OS: 55\%, 72\%, 75\%, and 86\%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P\,=\,0.002) cohorts and immune pathology (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Specifically, we identified a favorable outcome group characterized by low CT intensity and high heterogeneity that exhibited low PDL1 and high CD3 infiltration, suggestive of a favorable immune activated state. We have developed a NSCLC radiomics signature based on the immune micro-environment and patient outcomes. This manuscript demonstrates model creation and validation in independent cohorts.},

Inspired by these results, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework with tailored proxy tasks for medical image analysis. Specifically, we propose: (i) a new 3D transformer-based model, dubbed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR), with a hierarchical encoder for self-supervised pre-training; (ii) tailored proxy tasks for learning the underlying pattern of human anatomy. We demonstrate successful pre-training of the proposed model on 5,050 publicly available computed tomography (CT) images from various body organs. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by fine-tuning the pre-trained models on the Beyond the Cranial Vault (BTCV) Segmentation Challenge with 13 abdominal organs and segmentation tasks from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset. Our model is currently the state-of-the-art (i.e. ranked 1st) on the public test leaderboards of both MSD and BTCV datasets. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is a feasible second-option other than an adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT); however, no definite conclusions have been drawn  about whether or not a NCT is associated with better clinical outcomes for IIIA  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: We reviewed 68 clinical IIIA  NSCLC patients who received preoperative chemotherapy (NCT group), and 535  pathological IIIA NSCLC patients who received ACT after surgery (ACT group). After a  1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), we compared the relapse-free survival (RFS) and  overall survival (OS) rates as the long-term clinical outcomes, and hospital stay,  surgery duration, postoperative complications as the short-term clinical outcomes.  To evaluate the predictive value of the NCT response, we also assessed the response  evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) response to NCT. RESULTS: There was no  significant difference in RFS or OS between the NCT group and ACT group (RFS:  P=0.1138; OS: P=0.4234). On multivariate analysis, large cell lung carcinoma  (P=0.0264), bilobectomy (P=0.0039) and clinical N2 stage (P=0.0309) were independent  predictive factors of a worse OS. Short-term clinical outcomes including the  hospital stay and postoperative complications had no statistically distinct  difference between the ACT and NCT groups. Meanwhile, the OS of the partial response  (PR) patients group was better than the stable disease/progressive disease (SD/PD)  (P=0.0205) and ACT (P=0.0442) group, but none of the clinical features we tested was  found to be a predictive factor for a PR response. CONCLUSIONS: There was a  non-significant difference between the long-term and short-term clinical outcomes of  both NCT and ACT. The OS of PR patients was better than SD/PD and ACT, indicating  that NCT response acts as a predictor for a higher long-term survival rate.},

  abstract = {Background Sarcopenia has been associated with poor survival among cancer patients. Normalized total psoas area (NTPA) has been used as a surrogate for defining  sarcopenia. Few data exist characterizing the impact of sarcopenia and other metrics  of fitness on clinical outcomes in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung  cancer (NSCLC) treated non-invasively with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Methods To assess the association between sarcopenia and clinical outcomes, we  conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients treated with SBRT from  2013 to 2019 . Overall survival (OS), local failure free survival (LFS), distant  failure free survival (DFS), NTPA, body mass index (BMI), and Charlson comorbidity  index (CCI) were included for analysis. NTPA was calculated by measuring the psoas  volume at the L3 vertebra and normalizing for patient height and gender. Survival  functions were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test and  Cox-proportional hazards were performed for categorical and continuous variables,  respectively. Significance was set as p {$<$} 0.05. Results A total of 91 patients met  the criteria. The median age was seven years and Karnofsky~Performance Status score  (KPS) was 80 (range: 60-100). Approximately 79\% of patients had T1 tumors. Median  radiation dose and number of fractions were 60 Gy (range: 45-60) and 5 fractions  (range: 3-5). Median NTPA was 531.16 mm(2)/m(2) (range: 90.4-1356.2). After  normalization (sarcopenia: {$<$}385 mm(2)/m(2),~female; {$<$}585 mm(2)/m(2,~)male), 39  patients (42.8\%) had sarcopenia. NTPA had no association with OS (p = 0.7), LFS (p =  0.9), or DFS (p = 0.5). Increasing BMI was associated with improved OS (HR 0.90, 95\%  CI 0.83-0.98). With a median follow-up of 23.4 months, median OS was 60, 60, and  45.9 months (p = 0.37) in all patients, non-sarcopenic patients, and sarcopenic  patients, respectively. Conclusion Sarcopenia was not associated with OS, LFS, or  DFS. Increasing BMI is associated with improved OS. Future, prospective work is  needed to define the impact of sarcopenia and other fitness metrics on clinical  outcomes among NSCLC patients treated non-invasively with SBRT.},

  abstract = {Modern epidemiologic studies often aim to evaluate the causal effect of a point exposure on the risk of a disease from cohort or case-control observational data. Because confounding bias is of serious concern in such non-experimental studies, investigators routinely adjust for a large number of potential confounders in a logistic regression analysis of the effect of exposure on disease outcome. Unfortunately, when confounders are not correctly modeled, standard logistic regression is likely biased in its estimate of the effect of exposure, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions. We partially resolve this serious limitation of standard logistic regression analysis with a new iterative approach that we call ProRetroSpective estimation, which carefully combines standard logistic regression with a logistic regression analysis in which exposure is the dependent variable and the outcome and confounders are the independent variables. As a result, we obtain a correct estimate of the exposure-outcome odds ratio, if either thestandard logistic regression of the outcome given exposure and confounding factors is correct, or the regression model of exposure given the outcome and confounding factors is correct but not necessarily both, that is, it is double-robust. In fact, it also has certain advantadgeous efficiency properties. The approach is general in that it applies to both cohort and case-control studies whether the design of the study is matched or unmatched on a subset of covariates. Finally, an application illustrates the methods using data from the National Cancer Institute's Black/White Cancer Survival Study.},

  abstract = {Catheter-based renal artery denervation has demonstrated to be effective in decreasing blood pressure among patients with refractory hypertension. The anatomic distribution of renal artery nerves may influence the safety and efficacy profile of this procedure. We aimed to describe the anatomic distribution and density of periarterial renal nerves in the porcine model. Thirty arterial renal sections were included in the analysis by harvesting a tissue block containing the renal arteries and perirenal tissue from each animal. Each artery was divided into 3 segments (proximal, mid, and distal) and assessed for total number, size, and depth of the nerves according to the location. Nerve counts were greatest proximally (45.62\% of the total nerves) and decreased gradually distally (mid, 24.58\%; distal, 29.79\%). The distribution in nerve size was similar across all 3 sections (∼40\% of the nerves, 50–100 μm; ∼30\%, 0–50 μm; ∼20\%, 100–200 μm; and ∼10\%, 200–500 μm). In the arterial segments ∼45\% of the nerves were located within 2 mm from the arterial wall whereas ∼52\% of all nerves were located within 2.5 mm from the arterial wall. Sympathetic efferent fibers outnumbered sensory afferent fibers overwhelmingly, intermixed within the nerve bundle. In the porcine model, renal artery nerves are seen more frequently in the proximal segment of the artery. Nerve size distribution appears to be homogeneous throughout the artery length. Nerve bundles progress closer to the arterial wall in the distal segments of the artery. This anatomic distribution may have implications for the future development of renal denervation therapies.}

METHODS: Individual data from node-negative patients with a detectable post-RP prostate-specific antigen (PSA) treated with SRT with or without concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) were obtained from 10 academic institutions. Freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and distant metastases (DM) rates were estimated, and predictive nomograms were generated. RESULTS: Overall, 2,460 patients with a median follow-up of 5 years were included; 599 patients (24\%) had a Gleason score (GS) ≤ 6, 1,387 (56\%) had a GS of 7, 244 (10\%) had a GS of 8, and 230 (9\%) had a GS of 9 to 10. There were 1,370 patients (56\%) with extraprostatic extension (EPE), 452 (18\%) with seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), 1,434 (58\%) with positive surgical margins, and 390 (16\%) who received ADT (median, 6 months). The median pre-SRT PSA was 0.5 ng/mL (interquartile range, 0.3 to 1.1). The 5-yr FFBF rate was 56\% overall, 71\% for those with a pre-SRT PSA level of 0.01 to 0.2 ng/mL (n = 441), 63\% for those with a PSA of 0.21 to 0.50 ng/mL (n = 822), 54\% for those with a PSA of 0.51 to 1.0 ng/mL (n = 533), 43\% for those with a PSA of 1.01 to 2.0 ng/mL (n = 341), and 37\% for those with a PSA {$>$} 2.0 ng/mL (n = 323); P {$<$} .001. On multivariable analysis, pre-SRT PSA, GS, EPE, SVI, surgical margins, ADT use, and SRT dose were associated with FFBF. Pre-SRT PSA, GS, SVI, surgical margins, and ADT use were associated with DM, whereas EPE and SRT dose were not. The nomogram concordance indices were 0.68 (FFBF) and 0.74 (DM). CONCLUSION: Early SRT at low PSA levels after RP is associated with improved FFBF and DM rates. Contemporary nomograms can estimate individual patient outcomes after SRT in the modern era.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of surgery-associated variables on recurrence rates after sigmoid resection for diverticulitis. METHODS: Patients who underwent elective sigmoid resection for uncomplicated diverticulitis between 1992 and 2000 at two tertiary referral centers were followed up for recurrent disease as the primary end point. Recurrence after surgery was defined as left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis, with consistent CT and/or contrast enema findings on admission and after six weeks. A logistic regression of the following variables was undertaken: patient demographics, duration of preoperative symptoms, previous admissions and abdominal surgery, surgical access (laparoscopic or open), postoperative complications, splenic flexure mobilization, anastomotic technique (handsewn or stapled), specimen length, inflammation at proximal resection margin, and anastomotic level (colosigmoid or colorectal). The last three variables were defined by the pathologist. Anastomosis level was based on muscle layer configuration (taeniae coli) at the distal resection margin. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-six patients (105 females) with a mean age of 60.4 (standard deviation, ± 10) years were available for follow-up at 67 ± 30 (range, 11–130) months. The median duration of preoperative symptoms was 18 (range, 12–120) months. All but one (99 percent) patient had at least one admission before surgery. One hundred forty (59 percent) and 96 (41 percent) patients underwent laparoscopic or open resection, respectively. The conversion rate was 13 percent (18 patients) in the former group and the 30-day complication rate was 23 percent, with 0.4 percent 30-day mortality and a 2.1 percent reoperation rate. The splenic flexure was mobilized in 109 patients (47 percent). Anastomoses were fashioned by stapler in 171 patients (73 percent) and were to the rectum in 143 patients (72 percent). Specimen length was 17.9 ± 5.9 (range, 9–47) cm with inflammation at the proximal margin in 30 patients (14 percent). Twelve (5 percent) patients developed a recurrence at a mean of 78 ± 25 (range, 34–109) months with reoperation in one (0.4 percent). The level of anastomosis was the only predictor of recurrence in regression analysis (P = 0.033). Patients with colosigmoid anastomosis had a four times higher risk of having a recurrence compared with patients with colorectal anastomosis (odds ratio, 95 percent confidence interval = 1.12, 14.96). CONCLUSION: Colorectal (rather than colosigmoid) anastomosis was the single predictor of lower recurrence rates after elective sigmoid resection for uncomplicated diverticulitis.},

There is no rational clinical need for elaborate staging procedures, eg, computed tomography scanning or bone marrow examination, in the majority of patients with small cell lung cancer. Adequate information for defining prognostic groups can be obtained by using performance status, lactate dehydrogenase, and other biochemical tests such as sodium, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin.

  abstract = {We recently validated a swine model in which chronic treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) produced an effective sympathectomy. These sympathectomized swine demonstrated a significantly attenuated hypertensive response when treated with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA). Because renal nerve activity is elevated and important in controlling renal function and blood pressure in the DOCA swine model, we wanted to study the effect of chronic sympathectomy on acute renal hemodynamics and tubular function. Kidney function was assessed in 14 DOCA-treated miniature swine, 8 of which were sympathectomized by chronic treatment with 6-OHDA, while 6 served as controls. Effective renal sympathectomy in this model has been previously confirmed by a significant reduction (97\%) of norepinephrine in renal cortical tissue. When anesthetized, mean arterial pressure and renal blood flow were similar between the two groups. Glomerular filtration rate was lower by 43\%, urine flow rate by 71\%, sodium excretion by 66\%, and potassium excretion by 48\% in the 6-OHDA DOCA animals. All of these parameters were significantly different from the intact DOCA controls. These results indicate that anesthetized, chronically sympathectomized swine exhibit decreased renal excretory function. The changes in renal function may have been due to the development of a tubular or glomerular supersensitivity to circulating antinatriuretic factors, since the 6-OHDA group had a 28\% greater pressor response to the alpha-agonist phenylephrine and a significantly greater fall in mean arterial pressure in response to alpha-blockade with prazosin when compared with the controls. These changes in renal function may also explain why the 6-OHDA animals demonstrated a slight increase in mean arterial pressure in response to DOCA. Because acute renal denervation in DOCA-treated swine produces a diuresis and natriuresis, this study affirms that there may be important functional differences in acutely versus chronically denervated kidneys for which the implications under normal physiologic conditions are unknown.},

Generally, not all patient profiles are observed uniformly in model development. As a result, sampling uncertainty varies between individual patients' predictions. We aimed to develop an intuitive measure of individual prediction uncertainty. The variance of a patient's prediction can be equated to the variance of the sample mean outcome in    n ∗   \$\$ \{n\}\_\{\textbackslash ast \} \$\$  hypothetical patients with the same predictor values. This hypothetical sample size    n ∗   \$\$ \{n\}\_\{\textbackslash ast \} \$\$  can be interpreted as the number of similar patients    n eff   \$\$ \{n\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{eff\}\} \$\$  that the prediction is effectively based on, given that the model is correct. For generalized linear models, we derived analytical expressions for the effective sample size. In addition, we illustrated the concept in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In model development,    n eff   \$\$ \{n\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{eff\}\} \$\$  can be used to balance accuracy versus uncertainty of predictions. In a validation sample, the distribution of    n eff   \$\$ \{n\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{eff\}\} \$\$  indicates which patients were more and less represented in the development data, and whether predictions might be too uncertain for some to be practically meaningful. In a clinical setting, the effective sample size may facilitate communication of uncertainty about predictions. We propose the effective sample size as a clinically interpretable measure of uncertainty in individual predictions. Its implications should be explored further for the development, validation and clinical implementation of prediction models.},

A deep convolutional neural network was trained and optimized with CT images from the training cohort (n = 750) and validation cohort (n = 93) to obtain a PD-L1 expression signature (PD-L1ES), which was evaluated using the test cohort (n = 96). Finally, a separate immunotherapy cohort (n = 94) was used to assess the prognostic value of PD-L1ES with respect to clinical outcome., Results: PD-L1ES was able to predict high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 ≥ 50\%) with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.75\textasciitilde 0.80), 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.59\textasciitilde 0.81), and 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.66\textasciitilde 0.85) in the training, validation, and test cohorts, respectively. In patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody, low PD-L1ES was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS 363 days in low score group vs 183 days in high score group; hazard ratio [HR]: 2.57, 95\% CI: 1.22\textasciitilde 5.44; P = 0.010). Additionally, when PD-L1ES was combined with a clinical model that was trained using age, sex, smoking history and family history of malignancy, the response to immunotherapy could be better predicted compared to either PD-L1ES or the clinical model alone., Conclusions: The deep learning model provides a noninvasive method to predict high PD-L1 expression of NSCLC and to infer clinical outcomes in response to immunotherapy. Additionally, this deep learning model combined with clinical models demonstrated improved stratification capabilities.},

Starting from structural‐semantical definitions of the probabilities of necessary or sufficient causation (or both), we show how to bound these quantities from data obtained in experimental and observational studies, under general assumptions concerning the data‐generating process. In particular, we strengthen the results of Pearl [39] by presenting sharp bounds based on combined experimental and nonexperimental data under no process assumptions, as well as under the mild assumptions of exogeneity (no confounding) and monotonicity (no prevention). These results delineate more precisely the basic assumptions that must be made before statistical measures such as the excess‐risk‐ratio could be used for assessing attributional quantities such as the probability of causation.},

  abstract = {Causal effect identification considers whether an interventional probability distribution can be uniquely determined without parametric assumptions from measured source distributions and structural knowledge on the generating system. While complete graphical criteria and procedures exist for many identification problems, there are still challenging but important extensions that have not been considered in the literature. To tackle these new settings, we present a search algorithm directly over the rules of do-calculus. Due to generality of do-calculus, the search is capable of taking more advanced data-generating mechanisms into account along with an arbitrary type of both observational and experimental source distributions. The search is enhanced via a heuristic and search space reduction techniques. The approach, called do-search, is provably sound, and it is complete with respect to identifiability problems that have been shown to be completely characterized by do-calculus. When extended with additional rules, the search is capable of handling missing data problems as well. With the versatile search, we are able to approach new problems such as combined transportability and selection bias, or multiple sources of selection bias. We perform a systematic analysis of bivariate missing data problems and study causal inference under case-control design. We also present the R package dosearch that provides an interface for a C++ implementation of the search.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor nutrition and hygiene make children vulnerable to delays in growth and development. We aimed to assess the effects of water quality, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional interventions individually or in combination on the cognitive, motor, and language development of children in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, we enrolled pregnant women in their first or second trimester from rural villages of Gazipur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and Tangail districts of central Bangladesh, with an average of eight women per cluster. Groups of eight geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomised, using a random number generator, into six intervention groups (all of which received weekly visits from a community health promoter for the first 6 months and every 2 weeks for the next 18 months) and a double-sized control group (no intervention or health promoter visit). The six intervention groups were: chlorinated drinking water; improved sanitation; handwashing with soap; combined water, sanitation, and handwashing; improved nutrition through counselling and provision of lipid-based nutrient supplements; and combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition. Here, we report on the prespecified secondary child development outcomes: gross motor milestone achievement assessed with the WHO module at age 1 year, and communication, gross motor, personal social, and combined scores measured by the Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire (EASQ) at age 2 years. Masking of participants was not possible. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01590095. FINDINGS: Between May 31, 2012, and July 7, 2013, 5551 pregnant women residing in 720 clusters were enrolled. Index children of 928 (17\%) enrolled women were lost to follow-up in year 1 and an additional 201 (3\%) in year 2. 4757 children were assessed at 1 year and 4403 at 2 years. At year 1, compared with the control group, the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group had a higher rate of attaining the standing alone milestone (hazard ratio 1·19, 95\% CI 1·01-1 ·40), and the nutrition group had a higher rate of attaining the walking alone milestone (1·32, 95\% CI 1·07-1·62). The combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition group had a higher rate of attaining the walking alone milestone than those in the water, sanitation, and handwashing group (1·29, 1·01-1·65). At 2 years, we noted beneficial effects in the combined EASQ score in all intervention groups, with effect sizes smallest in the water treatment group (difference 0·15, 95\% CI 0·04 to 0·26 vs control) and largest in the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition treatment group (0·37, 0·27-0·46). INTERPRETATION: Improvements in water quality, handwashing, sanitation, or nutrition supported by intensive interpersonal communication, when delivered either individually or in combination, contributed to improvements in child development. A crucial next step is to establish whether similar effects can be achieved with reduced intensity of promoter contacts that could be supported in large-scale interventions.

Here, we show that the lifetime risk of cancers of many different types is strongly correlated (0.81) with the total number of divisions of the normal self-renewing cells maintaining that tissue's homeostasis. These results suggest that only a third of the variation in cancer risk among tissues is attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions. The majority is due to “bad luck,” that is, random mutations arising during DNA replication in normal, noncancerous stem cells.

After immunohistochemical staining using antibodies to vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) and protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), the presence of baroreceptor tissue was studied using light microscopic techniques. RESULTS: Visual assessment indicated that VGLUT2 and PGP 9.5 immunoreactivity was present in the adventitia of the carotid arteries and that nerve density was highest in the medial wall of the proximal first cm of the internal carotid artery (ICA). CONCLUSION: Human carotid baroreceptors, as reflected in immunoreactivity for VGLUT2 and PGP 9.5, are mainly localized in the medial portions of the proximal ICA. If surgical carotid denervation is indicated in patients suffering from carotid sinus syndrome, adventitial stripping of the proximal portion of the ICA should be sufficient.},

METHODS AND MATERIALS:  Records of 789 stages IIIA/B squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC) patients treated with  C-CRT who received 1 to 3 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy during 60 to  66~Gy radiation therapy (RT) were analyzed retrospectively. Primary endpoint was the  association between overall survival (OS) and pretreatment TC status. Secondary  endpoints included locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), progression-free  survival (PFS), and incidence of TC and correlated factors. RESULTS: Pretreatment TC  occurred in 95 patients (12\%), being significantly more common in those patients  with ever-smoking history (12.6\% vs 3.9\%; P~{$<~$}.001), weight loss {$>$}5\% (20.9\% vs 7.1\%;  P~{$<~$}.001), and hemoptysis (27.1\% vs 6.4\%; P~{$<~$}.001). Rates of acute and late  toxicities were similar in patients who presented with and without TC (P~{$>~$}.05 for  each). For the whole cohort, at a median follow-up of 22.9~months (range: 2.4-71.1),  the respective median OS, LRPFS, and PFS estimates were 23.7, 14.7, and 10.7~months.

However, there are concerns that Gln might stimulate tumor growth, and therefore negatively impact the outcomes of anticancer treatment. We retrospectively investigated the effect of co-administration of oral Gln during C-CRT on survival outcomes of patients with stage IIIB non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We additionally evaluated role of oral Gln in preventing C-CRT-induced weight change, acute and late toxicities. METHODS: The study included 104 patients: 56 (53.8\%) received prophylactic powdered Gln (Gln+) orally at a dose of 10 g/8 h and 48 (46.2\%) did not receive Gln (Gln-) and served as controls. The prescribed radiation dose to the planning target volume was 66 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), local/regional progression-free survival (LRPFS), and overall survival (OS) were correlated with status of Gln supplementation. RESULTS: Oral Gln was well tolerated except for mild nausea/vomiting in 14 (25.0\%) patients. There was no C-CRT-related acute or late grade 4-5 toxicity. Administration of Gln was associated with a decrease in the incidence of grade 3 acute radiation-induced esophagitis (RIE) (7.2\% vs. 16.7\% for Gln+ vs. Gln-; p=0.02) and late-RIE (0\% vs. 6.3\%; p=0.06), a reduced need for unplanned treatment breaks (7.1\% vs. 20.8\%; p=0.04), and reduced incidence of weight loss (44.6\% vs. 72.9\%; p=0.002). At a median follow-up of 24.2 months (range 9.2-34.4) the median OS, LRPFS, and PFS for Gln+ vs. Gln- cohorts were 21.4 vs. 20.4 (p=0.35), 14.2 vs.11.3 (p=0.16), and 10.2 vs. 9.0 months (p=0.11), respectively. CONCLUSION: In our study, supplementation with Gln during C-CRT had no detectable negative impact on tumor control and survival outcomes in patients with Stage IIIB NSCLC. Furthermore, Gln appeared to have a beneficial effect with respect to prevention of weight loss and unplanned treatment delays, and reduced the severity and incidence of acute- and late-RIE.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is regarded as one of the major breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds-urging the quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are related to and may therefore act as noninvasive radiomic biomarkers for immunotherapy response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We carried out an AI-based characterization of each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and validate a noninvasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing between immunotherapy responding and nonresponding. To define the biological basis of the radiographic biomarker, we carried out gene set enrichment analysis in an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients. RESULTS: The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to 0.83 AUC, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64 AUC, P\,=\,0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level, immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both cancer types (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), resulting in a 1-year survival difference of 24\% (P\,=\,0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and preferential response to immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions on standard-of-care imaging may function as noninvasive biomarkers for response to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.},

  abstract = {BackgroundNutritional derangements are common hallmarks of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, their early detection is overlooked in clinical  routine. This study aimed to evaluate nutritional status and its correlation with  outcome in NSCLC patients.MethodsData regarding NSCLC patients undergoing  nutritional evaluation were prospectively collected (May 2016-October 2018).  Nutritional risk was assessed by Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002).  Bilateral psoas major muscles were measured at L3 vertebrae level with routine  staging-computed tomography and changes were evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank  test. Clinico-pathological and nutritional data were correlated to  progression-free/overall survival (PFS/OS) and response rate (ORR) using a Cox and  logistic regression model. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared with log-rank  test.ResultsThirty-eight patients were included. The majority (65.8\%) of them were  at nutritional risk (NRS-2002 ≥3). At multivariate analysis for patients with  advanced disease, age (HR 2.44, p=0.05), performance status (HR 2.48, p=0.043) and  NRS-2002 (HR 1.74, p=0.001) were significant independent predictors for PFS and  weight loss (HR 1.07, p=0.008) for OS. Patients with baseline NRS-2002 {$<$}3 had  significantly longer 1-year PFS (85.7\% vs 19.4\%, p=0.02) and higher ORR (66.7\% vs  21.4\%) than those with NRS-2002 ≥3. An explorative evaluation demonstrated that  NRS-2002 score significantly decreased after nutritional intervention (p=0.001) for  3\,months.ConclusionBaseline nutritional risk represents a prognostic factor in  NSCLC. Nutritional counselling should be applied as a fundamental tool to improve  nutritional risk in a short period, ameliorating patients' outcome.},

Among the characteristics of patients with RH, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and aldosterone excess are covering a great area of the mosaic of RH phenotype. Increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity is present in all these underlying conditions, supporting its crucial role in the pathophysiology of antihypertensive treatment resistance. Current clinical and experimental knowledge points towards an impact of several factors on SNS activation, namely, insulin resistance, adipokines, endothelial dysfunction, cyclic intermittent hypoxaemia, aldosterone effects on central nervous system, chemoreceptors, and baroreceptors dysregulation. The further investigation and understanding of the mechanisms leading to SNS activation could reveal novel therapeutic targets and expand our treatment options in the challenging management of RH.},

Experts of the ESH Working Group for the interventional treatment of hypertension prepared this position paper in order to provide interventionalists with guidance through the procedure of RDN. Given that there is no established intraprocedural control of ablation success, interventionalists have to be familiar with the aspects related to the anatomy and imaging of the renal arteries, the distribution of renal sympathetic fibres, the special equipment necessary for RDN and the procedural details in order to maximise the success and minimise potential complications.}

  abstract = {Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting programmed cell death-1, significantly prolongs survival for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  However, little is known about the value of predictive biomarkers. Hence, we  investigated the impact of skeletal muscle (SM) mass loss on clinical outcomes in  NSCLC patients undergoing nivolumab treatment. Thirty patients with histologically  confirmed NSCLC treated with nivolumab were included in this study. Computed  tomography was used to determine SM loss based on the SM index (SMI). The SMI is the  cross-sectional area of the bilateral psoas muscles at the third lumbar vertebra,  divided by height squared. The cut-off values were defined as 6.36{$\mkern1mu$}cm/m for men and  3.92{$\mkern1mu$}cm/m for women. Among the 30 patients, 13 (43\%) had SM loss. There was no  significant association between SM loss and immune-related adverse events. The SM  loss group had undergone significantly more prior chemotherapy cycles (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.04). SM  loss was significantly associated with fewer nivolumab cycles (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.01). No patients  in the SM loss group achieved a partial response. Patients with SM loss had a  significantly shorter progression-free survival period (P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.008) and median overall  survival than those with normal SM mass (10 vs 25 months, respectively, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}.03). SM  loss was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival. In conclusion, SM loss  may be a predictive factor of poor outcomes in NSCLS patients undergoing nivolumab  therapy.},

  abstract = {We explored the association between liver metastases, tumor CD8+ T-cell count, and response in patients with melanoma or lung cancer treated with the anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab. The melanoma discovery cohort was drawn from the phase I Keynote 001 trial, whereas the melanoma validation cohort was drawn from Keynote 002, 006, and EAP trials and the non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort from Keynote 001. Liver metastasis was associated with reduced response and shortened progression-free survival [PFS; objective response rate (ORR), 30.6\%; median PFS, 5.1 months] compared with patients without liver metastasis (ORR, 56.3\%; median PFS, 20.1 months) P ≤ 0.0001, and confirmed in the validation cohort (P = 0.0006). The presence of liver metastasis significantly increased the likelihood of progression (OR, 1.852; P {$<$} 0.0001). In a subset of biopsied patients (n = 62), liver metastasis was associated with reduced CD8+ T-cell density at the invasive tumor margin (liver metastasis+ group, n = 547 ± 164.8; liver metastasis− group, n = 1,441 ± 250.7; P {$<$} 0.016). A reduced response rate and shortened PFS was also observed in NSCLC patients with liver metastasis [median PFS, 1.8 months; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.4–2.0], compared with those without liver metastasis (n = 119, median PFS, 4.0 months; 95\% CI, 2.1–5.1), P = 0.0094. Thus, liver metastatic patients with melanoma or NSCLC that had been treated with pembrolizumab were associated with reduced responses and PFS, and liver metastases were associated with reduced marginal CD8+ T-cell infiltration, providing a potential mechanism for this outcome.},

  abstract = {In network meta‐analysis, studies evaluating multiple treatment comparisons are modeled simultaneously, and estimation is informed by a combination of direct and indirect evidence. Network meta‐analysis relies on an assumption of consistency, meaning that direct and indirect evidence should agree for each treatment comparison. Here we propose new local and global tests for inconsistency and demonstrate their application to three example networks. Because inconsistency is a property of a loop of treatments in the network meta‐analysis, we locate the local test in a loop. We define a model with one inconsistency parameter that can be interpreted as loop inconsistency. The model builds on the existing ideas of               node‐splitting               and               side‐splitting               in network meta‐analysis. To provide a global test for inconsistency, we extend the model across multiple independent loops with one degree of freedom per loop. We develop a new algorithm for identifying independent loops within a network meta‐analysis. Our proposed models handle treatments symmetrically, locate inconsistency in loops rather than in nodes or treatment comparisons, and are invariant to choice of reference treatment, making the results less dependent on model parameterization. For testing global inconsistency in network meta‐analysis, our global model uses fewer degrees of freedom than the existing design‐by‐treatment interaction approach and has the potential to increase power. To illustrate our methods, we fit the models to three network meta‐analyses varying in size and complexity. Local and global tests for inconsistency are performed and we demonstrate that the global model is invariant to choice of independent loops.},

  abstract = {Purpose Studies have shown an association between socioeconomic status (SES) and quality of oncology care, but less is known about the impact of patient SES on clinical trial participation. Patients and Methods We assessed clinical trial participation patterns according to important SES (income, education) and demographic factors in a large sample of patients surveyed via an Internet-based treatment decision tool. Logistic regression, conditioning on type of cancer, was used. Attitudes toward clinical trials were assessed using prespecified items about treatment, treatment tolerability, convenience, and cost. Results From 2007 to 2011, 5,499 patients were successfully surveyed. Forty percent discussed clinical trials with their physician, 45\% of discussions led to physician offers of clinical trial participation, and 51\% of offers led to clinical trial participation. The overall clinical trial participation rate was 9\%. In univariate models, older patients (P = .002) and patients with lower income (P = .001) and education (P = .02) were less likely to participate in clinical trials. In a multivariable model, income remained a statistically significant predictor of clinical trial participation (odds ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.94; P = .01). Even in patients age ≥ 65 years, who have universal access to Medicare, lower income predicted lower trial participation. Cost concerns were much more evident among lower-income patients (P {$<$} .001). Conclusion Lower-income patients were less likely to participate in clinical trials, even when considering age group. A better understanding of why income is a barrier may help identify ways to make clinical trials better available to all patients and would increase the generalizability of clinical trial results across all income levels.},

  abstract = {A 68-year-old woman with resistant essential arterial hypertension despite the regular use of four antihypertensive drugs was referred to the catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation. Due to the complicated anatomy, insertion of the guiding catheter into the left renal artery was not stable. Thus, renal denervation of only the right renal artery was performed. Before and after renal denervation, the patient's blood pressure was monitored by home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring. The average 7-day home BP telemonitoring values before and 1, 2, and 3 months after denervation were 187.1/124.1, 193.3/123.1, 198.3/129.6, and 195.2/128.0 mm Hg. After unilateral renal denervation, no BP decrease occurred. This unique case suggests that unilateral catheter-based renal sympathetic denervation in resistant arterial hypertension shows no BP-lowering effect. Therefore, when treating resistant hypertension by catheter-based renal denervation, it seems advisable to try always to perform an effective bilateral procedure.}

  abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a ubiquitous diagnostic modality. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied towards ECG analysis require large sample sizes, and transfer learning approaches for biomedical problems may result in suboptimal performance when pre-training is done on natural images. We leveraged masked image modeling to create a vision-based transformer model, HeartBEiT, for electrocardiogram waveform analysis. We pre-trained this model on 8.5 million ECGs and then compared performance vs. standard CNN architectures for diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, low left ventricular ejection fraction and ST elevation myocardial infarction using differing training sample sizes and independent validation datasets. We find that HeartBEiT has significantly higher performance at lower sample sizes compared to other models. We also find that HeartBEiT improves explainability of diagnosis by highlighting biologically relevant regions of the EKG vs. standard CNNs. Domain specific pre-trained transformer models may exceed the classification performance of models trained on natural images especially in very low data regimes. The combination of the architecture and such pre-training allows for more accurate, granular explainability of model predictions.},

We present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep learning method for long-term pan-cancer survival prediction. MultiSurv uses dedicated submodels to establish feature representations of clinical, imaging, and different high-dimensional omics data modalities. A data fusion layer aggregates the multimodal representations, and a prediction submodel generates conditional survival probabilities for follow-up time intervals spanning several decades. MultiSurv is the first non-linear and non-proportional survival prediction method that leverages multimodal data. In addition, MultiSurv can handle missing data, including single values and complete data modalities. MultiSurv was applied to data from 33 different cancer types and yields accurate pan-cancer patient survival curves. A quantitative comparison with previous methods showed that Multisurv achieves the best results according to different time-dependent metrics. We also generated visualizations of the learned multimodal representation of MultiSurv, which revealed insights on cancer characteristics and heterogeneity.},

We aimed to investigate whether immunotherapy [18F]FDG PET radiomics signature (iRADIOMICS) predicts response of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to pembrolizumab better than the current clinical standards. Patients and methods Thirty patients receiving pembrolizumab were scanned with [18F]FDG PET/CT at baseline, month 1 and 4. Associations of six robust primary tumour radiomics features with overall survival were analysed with Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU), Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, and ROC curve analysis. iRADIOMICS was constructed using univariate and multivariate logistic models of the most promising feature(s). Its predictive power was compared to PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) and iRECIST using ROC curve analysis. Prediction accuracies were assessed with 5-fold cross validation. Results The most predictive were baseline radiomics features, e.g. Small Run Emphasis (MWU, p = 0.001; hazard ratio = 0.46, p = 0.007; AUC = 0.85 (95\% CI 0.69–1.00)). Multivariate iRADIOMICS was found superior to the current standards in terms of predictive power and timewise with the following AUC (95\% CI) and accuracy (standard deviation): iRADIOMICS (baseline), 0.90 (0.78–1.00), 78\% (18\%); PD-L1 TPS (baseline), 0.60 (0.37–0.83), 53\% (18\%); iRECIST (month 1), 0.79 (0.62–0.95), 76\% (16\%); iRECIST (month 4), 0.86 (0.72–1.00), 76\% (17\%). Conclusions Multivariate iRADIOMICS was identified as a promising imaging biomarker, which could improve management of metastatic NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. The predicted non-responders could be offered other treatment options to improve their overall survival.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates has increased worldwide. Fecal carriage of ESBL-producing isolates has mainly been detected in nosocomial outbreaks, and few studies have evaluated fecal carriage during nonoutbreak situations and among patients in the community. We have studied the prevalence of ESBLs in 1,239 fecal samples from 849 patients (64.1\% of whom were ambulatory) in 1991 and have compared the prevalence data with those obtained in 2003 for 400 fecal samples from 386 patients (75.9\% of whom were ambulatory) and 108 samples from independent healthy volunteers. Samples were diluted in saline and cultured in two MacConkey agar plates supplemented with ceftazidime (1 μg/ml) and cefotaxime (1 μg/ml), respectively. Colonies were screened (by the double-disk synergy test) for ESBL production. The clonal relatedness of all ESBL-producing isolates was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with XbaI digestion; and the ESBLs of all ESBL-producing isolates were characterized by isoelectric focusing, PCR, and sequencing. The rates of fecal carriage of ESBL-producing isolates increased significantly (P {$<$} 0.001) in both hospitalized patients and outpatients, from 0.3 and 0.7\%, respectively, in 1991, to 11.8 and 5.5\%, respectively, in 2003. The rate of occurrence of ESBL-producing isolates among healthy volunteers was 3.7\%. All ESBL-producing isolates recovered in 2003 were nonepidemic clones of Escherichia coli. ESBL characterization revealed an increasing diversity of ESBL types: TEM-4 and CTX-M-10 were the only enzymes detected in 1991, whereas TEM-4, TEM-52, SHV-12, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-10, CTX-M-14, and a CTX-M-2-like enzyme were recovered in 2003. The ESBL-producing isolates recovered from outpatients in 2003 corresponded to a CTX-M-9-type cluster (62.5\%) and SHV-12 (31.2\%), whereas TEM-4 was detected only in hospitalized patients. The frequencies of coresistance in isolates recovered in 2003 were as follows: sulfonamide, 75\%; tetracycline, 64.3\%; streptomycin, 57.1\%; quinolones, 53.5\%; and trimethoprim, 50\%. The increased prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL-producing isolates during nonoutbreak situations in hospitalized patients and the establishment of these isolates in the community with coresistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics, including quinolones, represent an opportunity for these isolates to become endemic.},

We hypothesize that increased muscle quantity is associated with better OS in patients with normal muscle radiodensity but not in patients with fatty degeneration of muscle tissue and low muscle radiodensity. We performed an observational cohort study in NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy. A deep learning algorithm was used to measure muscle quantity as psoas muscle index (PMI) and psoas muscle radiodensity (PMD) on computed tomography. The potential interaction between PMI and PMD for OS was investigated using Cox proportional-hazards regression. Baseline adjustment variables were age, sex, histology, performance score and body mass index. We investigated non-linear effects of continuous variables and imputed missing values using multiple imputation. We included 2840 patients and observed 1975 deaths in 5903 patient years. The average age was 68.9 years (standard deviation 10.4, range 32 to 96) and 1692 patients (59.6\%) were male. PMI was more positively associated with OS for higher values of PMD (hazard ratio for interaction 0.915; 95\% confidence interval 0.861–0.972; p-value 0.004). We found evidence that high muscle quantity is associated with better OS when muscle radiodensity is higher, in a large cohort of NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy. Future studies on the association between muscle status and OS should accommodate this interaction in their analysis for more accurate and more generalizable results.},

RCTs provide estimates of the average effects of treatments on groups of patients, but they may not apply in many real-world scenarios where for example patients have different characteristics than the RCT participants, or where different treatment variants are considered. Causal inference defines what a treatment effect is and how it may be estimated with RCTs or outside of RCTs with observational – or ‘real-world’ – data. In this review, we introduce the field of causal inference, explain what a treatment effect is and what important challenges are with treatment effect estimation with observational data. We then provide a framework for conducting causal inference studies and describe when in oncology causal inference from observational data may be particularly valuable. Recognizing the strengths and limitations of both RCTs and observational causal inference provides a way for more informed and individualized treatment decision-making in oncology.},

  abstract = {Prediction models inform important clinical decisions, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The predictive performance of these models is typically assessed through discrimination and calibration. However, changes in the distribution of the data impact model performance. In health-care, a typical change is a shift in case-mix: for example, for cardiovascular risk managment, a general practitioner sees a different mix of patients than a specialist in a tertiary hospital. This work introduces a novel framework that differentiates the effects of case-mix shifts on discrimination and calibration based on the causal direction of the prediction task. When prediction is in the causal direction (often the case for prognosis preditions), calibration remains stable under case-mix shifts, while discrimination does not. Conversely, when predicting in the anti-causal direction (often with diagnosis predictions), discrimination remains stable, but calibration does not. A simulation study and empirical validation using cardiovascular disease prediction models demonstrate the implications of this framework. This framework provides critical insights for evaluating and deploying prediction models across different clinical settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding the causal structure of the prediction task.},

Estimates of the               conditional average treatment effect               (CATE) are more useful for individualized treatment decision-making, but randomized trials are often too small to estimate the CATE. Examples in medical literature make use of the               relative               treatment effect (e.g. an odds ratio) reported by randomized trials to estimate the CATE using large observational datasets. One approach to estimating these CATE models is by using the relative treatment effect as an               offset               , while estimating the covariate-specific untreated risk. We observe that the odds ratios reported in randomized controlled trials are not the odds ratios that are needed in offset models because trials often report the               marginal               odds ratio. We introduce a constraint or a regularizer to better use marginal odds ratios from randomized controlled trials and find that under the standard observational causal inference assumptions, this approach provides a consistent estimate of the CATE. Next, we show that the offset approach is not valid for CATE estimation in the presence of unobserved confounding. We study if the offset assumption and the marginal constraint lead to better approximations of the CATE relative to the alternative of using the average treatment effect estimate from the randomized trial. We empirically show that when the underlying CATE has sufficient variation, the constraint and offset approaches lead to closer approximations to the CATE.},

  abstract = {Treatment decisions in cancer care are guided by treatment effect estimates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RCTs estimate the average effect of one treatment versus another in a certain population. However, treatments may not be equally effective for every patient in a population. Knowing the effectiveness of treatments tailored to specific patient and tumor characteristics would enable individualized treatment decisions. Getting tailored treatment effects by averaging outcomes in different patient subgroups in RCTs requires an unfeasible number of patients to have sufficient statistical power in all relevant subgroups for all possible treatments. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recommends that researchers develop outcome prediction models (OPMs) in an effort to individualize treatment decisions. OPMs sometimes called risk models or prognosis models, use patient and tumor characteristics to predict a patient outcome such as overall survival. The assumption is that the predictions are useful for treatment decisions using rules such as "prescribe chemotherapy only if the OPM predicts the patient has a high risk of recurrence". Recognizing the importance of reliable predictions, the AJCC published a checklist for OPMs to ensure dependable OPM prediction accuracy in the patient population for which the OPM was designed. However, accurate outcome predictions do not imply that these predictions yield good treatment decisions. In this perspective, we show that OPM rely on a fixed treatment policy which implies that OPM that were found to accurately predict outcomes in validation studies can still lead to patient harm when used to inform treatment decisions. We then give guidance on how to develop models that are useful for individualized treatment decisions and how to evaluate whether a model has value for decision-making.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has shown remarkable results for image analysis and is expected to aid individual treatment decisions in health care. Treatment recommendations are predictions with an inherently causal interpretation. To use deep learning for these applications in the setting of observational data, deep learning methods must be made compatible with the required causal assumptions. We present a scenario with real-world medical images (CT-scans of lung cancer) and simulated outcome data. Through the data simulation scheme, the images contain two distinct factors of variation that are associated with survival, but represent a collider (tumor size) and a prognostic factor (tumor heterogeneity), respectively. When a deep network would use all the information available in the image to predict survival, it would condition on the collider and thereby introduce bias in the estimation of the treatment effect. We show that when this collider can be quantified, unbiased individual prognosis predictions are attainable with deep learning. This is achieved by (1) setting a dual task for the network to predict both the outcome and the collider and (2) enforcing a form of linear independence of the activation distributions of the last layer. Our method provides an example of combining deep learning and structural causal models to achieve unbiased individual prognosis predictions. Extensions of machine learning methods for applications to causal questions are required to attain the long-standing goal of personalized medicine supported by artificial intelligence.},

We identified an unobserved confounder in observational cancer research: overall fitness. Proxy measurements of overall fitness exist like performance score, but the fitness as observed by the treating physician is unavailable for research. PROTECT reconstructs the distribution of the unobserved confounder based on these proxy measurements to estimate the treatment effect.

  abstract = {Background Renal Denervation as a possible treatment for hypertension has been studied extensively, but knowledge on the distribution of nerves surrounding the renal artery is still incomplete. While sympathetic and sensory nerves have been demonstrated, there is no mention of the presence of parasympathetic nerve fibers. Objectives To provide a description of the distribution patterns of the renal nerves in man, and, in addition, provide a detailed representation of the relative contribution of the sympathetic, parasympathetic and afferent divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Methods Renal arteries of human cadavers were each divided into four longitudinal segments and immunohistochemically stained with specific markers for afferent, parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Nerve fibers were semi-automatically quantified by computerized image analysis, and expressed as cross-sectional area relative to the distance to the lumen. Results A total of 3372 nerve segments were identified in 8 arteries of 7 cadavers. Sympathetic, parasympathetic and afferent nerves contributed for 73.5\% (95\% CI: 65.4–81.5\%), 17.9\% (10.7–25.1\%) and 8.7\% (5.0–12.3\%) of the total cross-sectional nerve area, respectively. Nerves are closer to the lumen in more distal segments and larger bundles that presumably innervate the kidney lie at 1–3.5 mm distance from the lumen. The tissue-penetration depth of the ablation required to destroy 50\% of the nerve fibers is 2.37 mm in the proximal segment and 1.78 mm in the most distal segments. Conclusion Sympathetic, parasympathetic and afferent nerves exist in the vicinity of the renal artery. The results warrant further investigation of the role of the parasympathetic nervous system on renal physiology, and may contribute to refinement of the procedure by focusing the ablation on the most distal segment.},

Intracranial hemorrhage rates were 1.4 (95\% CI, 1.3-1.5) per 100 person-years overall, 0.18 (95\% CI, 0.10-0.30) after microsurgery, 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.5-1.8) after SRS, and 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.3-2.3) after embolization. More recent studies were associated with lower case-fatality rates (rate ratio [RR], 0.972; 95\% CI, 0.955-0.989) but increased rates of hemorrhage (RR, 1.02; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.03). Male sex (RR, 0.964; 95\% CI, 0.945-0.984), small brain AVMs (RR, 0.988; 95\% CI, 0.981-0.995), and those with strictly deep venous drainage (RR, 0.975; 95\% CI, 0.960-0.990) were associated with lower case fatality. Lower hemorrhage rates were associated with male sex (RR, 0.976, 95\% CI, 0.964-0.988), small brain AVMs (RR, 0.988, 95\% CI, 0.980-0.996), and brain AVMs with deep venous drainage (0.982, 95\% CI, 0.969-0.996). Complications leading to permanent neurological deficits or death occurred in a median 7.4\% (range, 0\%-40\%) of patients after microsurgery, 5.1\% (range, 0\%-21\%) after SRS, and 6.6\% (range, 0\%-28\%) after embolization. Successful brain AVM obliteration was achieved in 96\% (range, 0\%-100\%) of patients after microsurgery, 38\% (range, 0\%-75\%) after SRS, and 13\% (range, 0\%-94\%) after embolization.Conclusions~Although case fatality after treatment has decreased over time, treatment of brain AVM remains associated with considerable risks and incomplete efficacy. Randomized controlled trials comparing different treatment modalities appear justified.}

Until now, data are inconclusive on which therapy to use as first-line treatment. The aim of this study was to use propensity score matching to compare first-line anti-PD-1 monotherapy vs. BRAF/MEK inhibitors in advanced BRAFV600-mutant melanoma patients. METHODS: We selected patients diagnosed between 2014 and 2017 with advanced melanoma and a known BRAFV600-mutation treated with first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitors or anti-PD-1 antibodies, registered in the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry. Patients were matched based on their propensity scores using the nearest neighbour and the optimal matching method. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2017, a total of 330 and 254 advanced melanoma patients received BRAF/MEK inhibitors and anti-PD-1 monotherapy as first-line systemic therapy. In the matched cohort, patients receiving anti-PD-1 antibodies as a first-line treatment had a higher median and 2-year overall survival compared to patients treated with first-line BRAF/MEK inhibitors, 42.3 months (95\% CI: 37.3-NE) vs. 19.8 months (95\% CI: 16.7-24.3) and 65.4\% (95\% CI: 58.1-73.6) vs. 41.7\% (95\% CI: 34.2-51.0). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in the matched BRAFV600-mutant advanced melanoma patients, anti-PD-1 monotherapy is the preferred first-line treatment in patients with relatively favourable patient and tumour characteristics.},

  abstract = {Objective Calibrated risk models are vital for valid decision support. We define four levels of calibration and describe implications for model development and external validation of predictions. Study Design and Setting We present results based on simulated data sets. Results A common definition of calibration is “having an event rate of R\% among patients with a predicted risk of R\%,” which we refer to as “moderate calibration.” Weaker forms of calibration only require the average predicted risk (mean calibration) or the average prediction effects (weak calibration) to be correct. “Strong calibration” requires that the event rate equals the predicted risk for every covariate pattern. This implies that the model is fully correct for the validation setting. We argue that this is unrealistic: the model type may be incorrect, the linear predictor is only asymptotically unbiased, and all nonlinear and interaction effects should be correctly modeled. In addition, we prove that moderate calibration guarantees nonharmful decision making. Finally, results indicate that a flexible assessment of calibration in small validation data sets is problematic. Conclusion Strong calibration is desirable for individualized decision support but unrealistic and counter productive by stimulating the development of overly complex models. Model development and external validation should focus on moderate calibration.},

  abstract = {Decision-analytic measures to assess clinical utility of prediction models and diagnostic tests incorporate the relative clinical consequences of true and false positives without the need for external information such as monetary costs. Net Benefit is a commonly used metric that weights the relative consequences in terms of the risk threshold at which a patient would opt for treatment. Theoretical results demonstrate that clinical utility is affected by a model’;s calibration, the extent to which estimated risks correspond to observed event rates. We analyzed the effects of different types of miscalibration on Net Benefit and investigated whether and under what circumstances miscalibration can make a model clinically harmful. Clinical harm is defined as a lower Net Benefit compared with classifying all patients as positive or negative by default. We used simulated data to investigate the effect of overestimation, underestimation, overfitting (estimated risks too extreme), and underfitting (estimated risks too close to baseline risk) on Net Benefit for different choices of the risk threshold. In accordance with theory, we observed that miscalibration always reduced Net Benefit. Harm was sometimes observed when models underestimated risk at a threshold below the event rate (as in underestimation and overfitting) or overestimated risk at a threshold above event rate (as in overestimation and overfitting). Underfitting never resulted in a harmful model. The impact of miscalibration decreased with increasing discrimination. Net Benefit was less sensitive to miscalibration for risk thresholds close to the event rate than for other thresholds. We illustrate these findings with examples from the literature and with a case study on testicular cancer diagnosis. Our findings strengthen the importance of obtaining calibrated risk models.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Deep neural networks (DNNs) perform excellently in interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs), both for conventional ECG interpretation and for novel applications such as detection of reduced ejection fraction (EF). Despite these promising developments, implementation is hampered by the lack of trustworthy techniques to explain the algorithms to clinicians. Especially, currently employed heatmap-based methods have shown to be inaccurate. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a novel pipeline consisting of a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to learn the underlying factors of variation of the median beat ECG morphology (the FactorECG), which are subsequently used in common and interpretable prediction models. As the ECG factors can be made explainable by generating and visualizing ECGs on both the model and individual level, the pipeline provides improved explainability over heatmap-based methods. By training on a database with 1.1 million ECGs, the VAE can compress the ECG into 21 generative ECG factors, most of which are associated with physiologically valid underlying processes. Performance of the explainable pipeline was similar to 'black box' DNNs in conventional ECG interpretation [area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) 0.94 vs. 0.96], detection of reduced EF (AUROC 0.90 vs. 0.91), and prediction of 1-year mortality (AUROC 0.76 vs. 0.75). Contrary to the 'black box' DNNs, our pipeline provided explainability on which morphological ECG changes were important for prediction. Results were confirmed in a population-based external validation dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies on DNNs for ECGs should employ pipelines that are explainable to facilitate clinical implementation by gaining confidence in artificial intelligence and making it possible to identify biased models.},

METHODS: Quantitative antibiotic susceptibility testing of K. pneumoniae was performed in a central laboratory using a microbroth dilution method. Breakpoints were as defined by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). The prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing isolates was determined. RESULTS: A significant increase in resistance among ICU isolates was observed for ceftazidime (4.2\%-10.8\%), ciprofloxacin (5.8\%-18.5\%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (11.9\%-23.1\%), and for cefuroxime (2.8\%-7.9\%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (13.5\%-27.8\%) among urology isolates. Among ICU isolates the prevalence of ESBLs increased significantly from 2\% to 8\%. Carbapenemase production was not demonstrated. Among ICU isolates the prevalence of multidrug resistance increased and has been ≥12\% since 2004. Among urology isolates multidrug resistance was highest in 2009 at 7.4\%. Overall, resistance was significantly higher among ICU isolates. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increase in resistance among ICU and urology isolates and an increased prevalence of ESBLs among ICU isolates. Carbapenemase production was not demonstrated. A regular update of empirical treatment protocols based on actual surveillance data is justified.},

  abstract = {Several staining concepts and color combinations exist to perform successful double immunoenzyme staining on human tissue specimens. Most of these concepts are based on differences between both primary antibodies: animal species, mouse Ig isotype or IgG subclasses, conjugates, or concentrations. Traditionally, double immunoenzyme staining has used chromogens selected to provide maximum color contrast when observed with the unaided eye. Unfortunately, visually good color combinations always include at least one diffuse chromogen, because of the paucity of appropriate chromogen colors. This situation is drastically changed with the use of spectral imaging, where multicolor microscopy can be unmixed in individual images based on their spectral characteristics. Spectral unmixing can be performed even up to quadruple immunoenzyme staining. This work contains practical suggestions for immunoenzyme double staining procedures for some frequently encountered primary antibody combinations: rabbit-mouse, goat-mouse, mouse-mouse, and rabbit-rabbit. The suggested protocols are all suitable for a classical red-brown color combination plus blue nuclear counterstain that is composed of peroxidase activity (diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride), alkaline phosphatase activity (Liquid Permanent Red), and hematoxylin, respectively. Although the red and brown chromogens do not contrast very well visually, they both show a crisp localization and can be perfectly unmixed by spectral imaging.}

The causal inference literature has not, however, produced a clear formal definition of a confounder, as it has given priority to the concept of confounding over that of a confounder. We consider a number of candidate definitions arising from various more informal statements made in the literature. We consider the properties satisfied by each candidate definition, principally focusing on (i) whether under the candidate definition control for all “confounders” suffices to control for “confounding” and (ii) whether each confounder in some context helps eliminate or reduce confounding bias. Several of the candidate definitions do not have these two properties. Only one candidate definition of those considered satisfies both properties. We propose that a “confounder” be defined as a pre-exposure covariate C for which there exists a set of other covariates X such that effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded conditional on (X, C) but such that for no proper subset of (X, C) is the effect of the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset. A variable that helps reduce bias but not eliminate bias we propose referring to as a “surrogate confounder.”},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is useful in assessing how robust an association is to potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding. This article introduces a new measure called the “E-value,” which is related to the evidence for causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding. The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment–outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates. A large E-value implies that considerable unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. A small E-value implies little unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. The authors propose that in all observational studies intended to produce evidence for causality, the E-value be reported or some other sensitivity analysis be used. They suggest calculating the E-value for both the observed association estimate (after adjustments for measured confounders) and the limit of the confidence interval closest to the null. If this were to become standard practice, the ability of the scientific community to assess evidence from observational studies would improve considerably, and ultimately, science would be strengthened.}

  abstract = {Prediction models are increasingly proposed for guiding treatment decisions, but most fail to address the special role of treatments, leading to inappropriate use. This paper highlights the limitations of using standard prediction models for treatment decision support. We identify 'causal blind spots' in three common approaches to handling treatments in prediction modelling and illustrate potential harmful consequences in several medical applications. We advocate for an extension of guidelines for development, reporting, clinical evaluation and monitoring of prediction models to ensure that the intended use of the model is matched to an appropriate risk estimand. For decision support this requires a shift towards developing predictions under the specific treatment options under consideration ('predictions under interventions'). We argue that this will improve the efficacy of prediction models in guiding treatment decisions and prevent potential negative effects on patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study approaches for dealing with treatment when developing a clinical prediction model. Analogous to the estimand framework recently proposed by the European Medicines Agency for clinical trials, we propose a ‘predictimand’ framework of different questions that may be of interest when predicting risk in relation to treatment started after baseline. We provide a formal definition of the estimands matching these questions, give examples of settings in which each is useful and discuss appropriate estimators including their assumptions. We illustrate the impact of the predictimand choice in a dataset of patients with end-stage kidney disease. We argue that clearly defining the estimand is equally important in prediction research as in causal inference.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer is not well established. We compared chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in this patient population. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable tumors to receive surgery alone or weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week), followed by surgery. RESULTS: From March 2004 through December 2008, we enrolled 368 patients, 366 of whom were included in the analysis: 275 (75\%) had adenocarcinoma, 84 (23\%) had squamous-cell carcinoma, and 7 (2\%) had large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Of the 366 patients, 178 were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, and 188 to surgery alone. The most common major hematologic toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group were leukopenia (6\%) and neutropenia (2\%); the most common major nonhematologic toxic effects were anorexia (5\%) and fatigue (3\%). Complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in 92\% of patients in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69\% in the surgery group (P{$<$}0.001). A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 161 patients (29\%) who underwent resection after chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative complications were similar in the two treatment groups, and in-hospital mortality was 4\% in both. Median overall survival was 49.4 months in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 24.0 months in the surgery group. Overall survival was significantly better in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.657; 95\% confidence interval, 0.495 to 0.871; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improved survival among patients with potentially curable esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer. The regimen was associated with acceptable adverse-event rates. (Funded by the Dutch Cancer Foundation [KWF Kankerbestrijding]; Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR487.).},

Methods ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were identified by combination disc-diffusion test. ESBL/AmpC/carbapenemase genes were analysed using PCR and sequencing. For E. coli, phylogenetic groups and MLST were determined. Plasmids were characterized by transformation and PCR-based replicon typing. Subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing. Results 175 ESC-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were cultured from 165/1,033 individuals. The isolates were Escherichia coli(n=65), Citrobacter freundii (n=52), Enterobacter cloacae (n=38), Morganella morganii (n=5), Enterobacter aerogenes (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=3), Hafnia alvei (n=2), Shigella spp. (n=2), Citrobacter amalonaticus (n=1), Escherichia hermannii (n=1), Kluyvera cryocrescens (n=1), and Pantoea agglomerans (n=1). The following ESBL genes were recovered in 55 isolates originating from 49 of 1,033 (4.7 \%) persons: blaCTX-M-1 (n=17), blaCTX-M-15 (n=16), blaCTX-M-14 (n=9), blaCTX-M-2 (n=3), blaCTX-M-3 (n=2), blaCTX-M-24 (n=2), blaCTX-M-27 (n=1), blaCTX-M-32 (n=1), blaSHV-12 (n=2), blaSHV-65 (n=1) and blaTEM-52 (n=1). Plasmidic AmpC (pAmpC) genes were discovered in 6 out of 1,033 (0.6 \%) persons. One person carried two different E. coli isolates, one with blaCTX-M-1 and the other with blaCMY-2 and therefore the prevalence of persons carrying Enterobacteriaceae harboring ESBL and/or pAmpC genes was 5.2 \%. In eight E. coli isolates the AmpC phenotype was caused by mutations in the AmpC promoter region. No carbapenemase genes were identified. A large variety of E. coli genotypes was found, ST131 and ST10 being most common. Conclusions ESBL/pAmpC genes resembled those from patients in Dutch hospitals, indicating that healthy humans form a reservoir for transmission of these determinants to vulnerable people. The role of poultry in the transmission to humans in the community remains to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that haemodiafiltration reduces mortality compared with haemodialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), but the controversy surrounding its benefits remains and it is unclear to what extent individual patients benefit from haemodiafiltration. This study is aimed to develop and validate a treatment effect prediction model to determine which patients would benefit most from haemodiafiltration compared with haemodialysis in terms of all-cause mortality. METHODS: Individual participant data from four randomized controlled trials comparing haemodiafiltration with haemodialysis on mortality were used to derive a Royston-Parmar model for the prediction of absolute treatment effect of haemodiafiltration based on pre-specified patient and disease characteristics. Validation of the model was performed using internal-external cross validation. RESULTS: The median predicted survival benefit was 44 (Q1-Q3: 44-46) days for every year of treatment with haemodiafiltration compared with haemodialysis. The median survival benefit with haemodiafiltration ranged from 2 to 48 months. Patients who benefitted most from haemodiafiltration were younger, less likely to have diabetes or a cardiovascular history and had higher serum creatinine and albumin levels. Internal-external cross validation showed adequate discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSION: Although overall mortality is reduced by haemodiafiltration compared with haemodialysis in ESKD patients, the absolute survival benefit can vary greatly between individuals. Our results indicate that the effects of haemodiafiltration on survival can be predicted using a combination of readily available patient and disease characteristics, which could guide shared decision-making.},

  abstract = {Introduction Prognosis prediction is central in treatment decision making and quality of life for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, conventional computed tomography (CT) related prognostic factors may not apply to the challenging stage III NSCLC group. The aim of this systematic review was therefore to identify and evaluate CT-related prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) of stage III NSCLC. Methods The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane electronic databases were searched. After study selection, risk of bias was estimated for the included studies. Meta-analysis of univariate results was performed when sufficient data were available. Results 1595 of the 11,996 retrieved records were selected for full text review, leading to inclusion of 65 studies that reported data of 144,513 stage III NSCLC patients andcompromising 26 unique CT-related prognostic factors. Relevance and validity varied substantially, few studies had low relevance and validity. Only four studies evaluated the added value of new prognostic factors compared with recognized clinical factors. Included studies suggested gross tumor volume (meta-analysis: HR~=~1.22, 95\%CI: 1.05–1.42), tumor diameter, nodal volume, and pleural effusion, are prognostic in patients treated with chemoradiation. Clinical T-stage and location (right/left) were likely not prognostic within stage III NSCLC. Inconclusive are several radiomic features, tumor volume, atelectasis, location (pulmonary lobes, central/peripheral), interstitial lung abnormalities, great vessel invasion, pit-fall sign, and cavitation. Conclusions Tumor-size and nodal size-related factors are prognostic for OS in stage III NSCLC. Future studies should carefully report study characteristics and contrast factors with guideline recognized factors to improve evidence evaluation and validation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE To compare the accuracy of computed tomography-(CT) scan and the radiolabeled glucose analog 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) visually correlated with CT (PET + CT) in the locoregional lymph node (LN) staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-eight patients with potentially operable NSCLC underwent thoracic CT, PET, and invasive surgical staging (ISS). Imaging studies were read prospectively and blinded to the surgical and pathologic data. A five-point visual scale was used for the interpretation of LNs on PET. Afterwards, with knowledge of the pathology, the relationship between standardized uptake values (SUVs) and the presence of metastasis in LNs was explored in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the likelihood ratios (LRs) for SUVs of LNs were determined. RESULTS ISS was available for 690 LN stations. CT correctly identified the nodal stage in 40 of 68 patients (59\%), with understaging in 12 patients and overstaging in 16 patients. PET + CT was accurate in 59 patients (87\%), with understaging in five patients and overstaging in four patients. In the detection of locally advanced disease (N2/N3), the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CT were 75\%, 63\%, and 68\%, respectively. For PET + CT, this was 93\%, 95\%, and 94\% (P = .0004). In the ROC curve, the best SUV threshold to distinguish benign from malignant LNs was 4.40. The analysis with this SUV threshold was not superior to the use of a five-point visual scale. The LR of a SUV less than 3.5 in an LN was 0.152; for a SUV between 3.5 and 4.5, it was 3.157; and for a SUV greater than 4.5, it was 253.096. CONCLUSION PET + CT is significantly more accurate than CT alone in LN staging of NSCLC. A five-point visual scale is as accurate as the use of an SUV threshold for LNs in the distinction between benign and malignant nodes. The very high negative predictive value of mediastinal PET could reduce the need for mediastinal ISS in NSCLC substantially.},

The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour1,2,3. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70–80\% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it4,5. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date6,7,8,9,10,11,12 allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases (‘poor prognosis’ signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

  abstract = {We abstract the concept of a randomized controlled trial as a triple (β,b,s), where β is the primary efficacy parameter, b the estimate, and s the standard error (s{$>$}0). If the parameter β is either a difference of means, a log odds ratio or a log hazard ratio, then it is reasonable to assume that b is unbiased and normally distributed. This then allows us to estimate the joint distribution of the z-value z=b/s and the signal-to-noise ratio SNR=β/s from a sample of pairs (bi,si). We have collected 23 551 such pairs from the Cochrane database. We note that there are many statistical quantities that depend on (β,b,s) only through the pair (z,SNR). We start by determining the estimated distribution of the achieved power. In particular, we estimate the median achieved power to be only 13\%. We also consider the exaggeration ratio which is the factor by which the magnitude of β is overestimated. We find that if the estimate is just significant at the 5\% level, we would expect it to overestimate the true effect by a factor of 1.7. This exaggeration is sometimes referred to as the winner's curse and it is undoubtedly to a considerable extent responsible for disappointing replication results. For this reason, we believe it is important to shrink the unbiased estimator, and we propose a method for doing so. We show that our shrinkage estimator successfully addresses the exaggeration. As an example, we re-analyze the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial.},

  abstract = {In anatomic pathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) serves as a diagnostic and prognostic method for identification of disease markers in tissue samples that directly influences classification and grading the disease, influencing patient management. However, till today over most of the world, pathological analysis of tissue samples remained a time-consuming and subjective procedure, wherein the intensity of antibody staining is manually judged and thus scoring decision is directly influenced by visual bias. This instigated us to design a simple method of automated digital IHC image analysis algorithm for an unbiased, quantitative assessment of antibody staining intensity in tissue sections. As a first step, we adopted the spectral deconvolution method of DAB/hematoxylin color spectra by using optimized optical density vectors of the color deconvolution plugin for proper separation of the DAB color spectra. Then the DAB stained image is displayed in a new window wherein it undergoes pixel-by-pixel analysis, and displays the full profile along with its scoring decision. Based on the mathematical formula conceptualized, the algorithm is thoroughly tested by analyzing scores assigned to thousands (n\&\#x200A;=\&\#x200A;1703) of DAB stained IHC images including sample images taken from human protein atlas web resource. The IHC Profiler plugin developed is compatible with the open resource digital image analysis software, ImageJ, which creates a pixel-by-pixel analysis profile of a digital IHC image and further assigns a score in a four tier system. A comparison study between manual pathological analysis and IHC Profiler resolved in a match of 88.6\% (P\&lt;0.0001, CI\&\#x200A;=\&\#x200A;95\%). This new tool developed for clinical histopathological sample analysis can be adopted globally for scoring most protein targets where the marker protein expression is of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear type. We foresee that this method will minimize the problem of inter-observer variations across labs and further help in worldwide patient stratification potentially benefitting various multinational clinical trial initiatives.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Such neuroimmune interactions have not been studied in the kidney. Here, we show that the rat kidney is innervated by both tyrosine hydroxylase-positive sympathetic efferent nerve fibers and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive primary afferent nerve fibers, both of which are found in proximity to macrophages and dendritic cells. Complete surgical bilateral renal denervation was performed 2 d before glomerulonephritis was induced by injecting the monoclonal anti-Thy-1.1 antibody OX-7. Denervation significantly reduced albuminuria, mesangiolysis, formation of microaneurysms, deposition of glomerular collagen IV, and expression of TGF-beta compared with sham-operated controls. Accordingly, inflammation, identified by accumulation of interstitial macrophages and renal expression of TNF-alpha, and mesangial cell proliferation were significantly reduced. These findings indicate that autonomic renal denervation ameliorates and, by inference, innervation exacerbates acute inflammation in the kidney; therefore, neurotransmitters or neuropeptides and their receptors might represent novel targets for the treatment of acute glomerulonephritis.},

Complications were classified according to the systems of the Association of Surgery of the Netherlands and the Trauma Registry of the American College of Surgeons.Main Outcome Measures Classification of complications and systems used to record them.Results Colorectal surgery was performed in 505 patients. In 181 patients, 437 complications were recorded, and 350 (80\%) of these events represented 13 types of complications. Different classification systems were used, and no consistent approach in classifying was seen. Anastomotic disruption (n~=~40), the most serious complication after colorectal surgery, was recorded as dehiscence 32 times (80\%) in the Association of Surgery of the Netherlands system and as anastomotic leak (code 4001) 24 times (60\%) in the Trauma Registry of the American College of Surgeons system.Conclusions Diverse classification systems were used for major complications after colorectal surgery. The differences in classifying seemed to be based on the interpretation of the recording physician. Emphasis should be placed on training physicians on a regular basis in documenting and classifying complications and providing feedback. The reporting process should focus on adequate and uniform classifying of events with major significance, eg, anastomotic disruption in colorectal surgery.}

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

However, inference about between‐study variability, which is typically modelled using a between‐study variance parameter, is usually an additional aim. The DerSimonian and Laird method, currently widely used by default to estimate the between‐study variance, has been long challenged. Our aim is to identify known methods for estimation of the between‐study variance and its corresponding uncertainty, and to summarise the simulation and empirical evidence that compares them. We identified 16 estimators for the between‐study variance, seven methods to calculate confidence intervals, and several comparative studies. Simulation studies suggest that for both dichotomous and continuous data the estimator proposed by Paule and Mandel and for continuous data the restricted maximum likelihood estimator are better alternatives to estimate the between‐study variance. Based on the scenarios and results presented in the published studies, we recommend the Q‐profile method and the alternative approach based on a ‘generalised Cochran between‐study variance statistic’ to compute corresponding confidence intervals around the resulting estimates. Our recommendations are based on a qualitative evaluation of the existing literature and expert consensus. Evidence‐based recommendations require an extensive simulation study where all methods would be compared under the same scenarios. © 2015 The Authors.

Isolation of carriers is one strategy that can be used to limit the spread of these bacteria. In this review, we critically examine the clinical performance, advantages, and disadvantages of methods available for the detection of intestinal carriage of CPOs. Culture-based methods (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] protocols, chromogenic media, specialized agars, and double-disk synergy tests) for detecting carriage of CPOs are convenient due to their ready availability and low cost, but their limited sensitivity and long turnaround time may not always be optimal for infection control practices. Contemporary nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) such as real-time PCR, hybridization assays, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), or a combined culture and NAAT approach may provide fast results and/or added sensitivity and specificity compared with culture-based methods. Infection control practitioners and clinical microbiologists should be aware of the strengths and limitations of available methods to determine the most suitable approach for their medical facility to fit their infection control needs.},

Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. Method. The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the “decision curve.” The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal. Conclusion. Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The clinical significance of a treatment effect demonstrated in a randomized trial is typically assessed by reference to differences in event rates at the group level. An alternative is to make individualized predictions for each patient based on a prediction model. This approach is growing in popularity, particularly for cancer. Despite its intuitive advantages, it remains plausible that some prediction models may do more harm than good. Here we present a novel method for determining whether predictions from a model should be used to apply the results of a randomized trial to individual patients, as opposed to using group level results. Methods: We propose applying the prediction model to a data set from a randomized trial and examining the results of patients for whom the treatment arm recommended by a prediction model is congruent with allocation. These results are compared with the strategy of treating all patients through use of a net benefit function that incorporates both the number of patients treated and the outcome. We examined models developed using data sets regarding adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer and Dutasteride for benign prostatic hypertrophy. Results: For adjuvant chemotherapy, we found that patients who would opt for chemotherapy even for small risk reductions, and, conversely, those who would require a very large risk reduction, would on average be harmed by using a prediction model; those with intermediate preferences would on average benefit by allowing such information to help their decision making. Use of prediction could, at worst, lead to the equivalent of an additional death or recurrence per 143 patients; at best it could lead to the equivalent of a reduction in the number of treatments of 25\% without an increase in event rates. In the Dutasteride case, where the average benefit of treatment is more modest, there is a small benefit of prediction modelling, equivalent to a reduction of one event for every 100 patients given an individualized prediction. Conclusion: The size of the benefit associated with appropriate clinical implementation of a good prediction model is sufficient to warrant development of further models. However, care is advised in the implementation of prediction modelling, especially for patients who would opt for treatment even if it was of relatively little benefit.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many decisions in medicine involve trade-offs, such as between diagnosing patients with disease versus unnecessary additional testing for those who are healthy. Net benefit is an increasingly reported decision analytic measure that puts benefits and harms on the same scale. This is achieved by specifying an exchange rate, a clinical judgment of the relative value of benefits (such as detecting a cancer) and harms (such as unnecessary biopsy) associated with models, markers, and tests. The exchange rate can be derived by asking simple questions, such as the maximum number of patients a doctor would recommend for biopsy to find one cancer. As the answers to these sorts of questions are subjective, it is possible to plot net benefit for a range of reasonable exchange rates in a “decision curve.” For clinical prediction models, the exchange rate is related to the probability threshold to determine whether a patient is classified as being positive or negative for a disease. Net benefit is useful for determining whether basing clinical decisions on a model, marker, or test would do more good than harm. This is in contrast to traditional measures such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the curve, which are statistical abstractions not directly informative about clinical value. Recent years have seen an increase in practical applications of net benefit analysis to research data. This is a welcome development, since decision analytic techniques are of particular value when the purpose of a model, marker, or test is to help doctors make better clinical decisions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The morphometry and composition of the intimal layer were studied in the arterial system of elderly individuals. Post mortem, a total of 703 arterial segments were dissected from 24 subjects (age 81.9 +/- 9.9 years). From each subject, segments were dissected from 31 different arteries. Area stenosis [(plaque area/vessel area) x 100\%] was determined in each segment. By (immuno)histochemistry, lipid content and the presence of inflammatory cells (macrophages) were assessed in the coronary, common carotid, brachial, radial and internal iliac arteries. Adaptive intimal thickening or advanced atherosclerosis was observed in all studied artery types. Area stenosis was highest in the coronary arteries (median, 30\%) and lowest in the arteries supplying the brain (median, \&lt; or = 7\%). Plaques hiding a lipid-rich core and plaques with macrophage infiltration were observed in all five selected artery types. In summary, the present observation demonstrates that intimal thickening is a systemic process involving most artery types. Within elderly humans, features of advanced atherosclerotic disease, a lipid-rich core and macrophages, can be observed in the intimal layer of artery types that are recognised for their relation with clinical syndroms as well as artery types that remain clinically silent.},

  abstract = {Modelling demand for radiotherapy is contingent on the uniform application of clinical practice guidelines. However, decision making in lung cancer is a complex process requiring the integration of multimodality treatment in patients who frequently have underlying comorbidities. Population studies have shown that guideline adherence in lung cancer is modest, ranging from 44 to 52\%. The application of guideline treatment decreases with increasing age and the presence of comorbidities. Patient and clinician attitudes also impact on this. In some regions, sociodemographic factors, such as lower income and non-White race, have been associated with a lack of guideline treatment. One of the major barriers in treating lung cancer patients according to guidelines is the mismatch between the clinic population and those enrolled in clinical trials from which evidence is derived. The lung cancer clinic population often consists of patients who are older, have multiple comorbidities and are of borderline performance status, all characteristics that are usually exclusion criteria for clinical trials. Hence, there is uncertainty not only about the magnitude of benefit, but also potential toxicities of guideline treatment. Further research is necessary in order to define the best treatment in these patients and thus increase the applicability of guidelines to the general lung cancer population. Lung cancer is an extreme example of the difficulties in translating evidence into clinical practice. The applicability of guidelines to specific cancer populations will affect the modelling of demand for radiotherapy and other treatment modalities.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover 3 main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors, to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all 3 study designs and 4 are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available at http://www.annals.org and on the Web sites of PLoS Medicine and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

An old answer is that 2–10 imputations usually suffice, but this recommendation only addresses the efficiency of point estimates. You may need more imputations if, in addition to efficient point estimates, you also want standard error (SE) estimates that would not change (much) if you imputed the data again. For replicable SE estimates, the required number of imputations increases quadratically with the fraction of missing information (not linearly, as previous studies have suggested). I recommend a two-stage procedure in which you conduct a pilot analysis using a small-to-moderate number of imputations, then use the results to calculate the number of imputations that are needed for a final analysis whose SE estimates will have the desired level of replicability. I implement the two-stage procedure using a new SAS macro called \%mi\_combine and a new Stata command called how\_many\_imputations.},

  abstract = {Background: The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a frequent incidental finding that may represent primary lung cancer or other malignant or benign lesions. The optimal management of the SPN remains unclear.Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review to address the following questions: (1) the prevalence of SPN; (2) the prevalence of malignancy in nodules with varying characteristics (size, morphology, and type of opacity); (3) the relationships between growth rates, histology, and other nodule characteristics; and (4) the performance characteristics and complication rates of tests for SPN diagnosis. We searched MEDLINE and other databases and used previous systematic reviews and recent primary studies.Results: Eight large trials of lung cancer screening showed that both the prevalence of at least one nodule (8 to 51\%) and the prevalence of malignancy in patients with nodules (1.1 to 12\%) varied considerably across studies. The prevalence of malignancy varied by size (0 to 1\% for nodules {$<$} 5 mm, 6 to 28\% for nodules 5 to 10 mm, and 64 to 82\% for nodules {$>$} 20 mm). Data from six studies of patients with incidental or screening-detected nodules showed that the risk for malignancy was approximately 20 to 30\% in nodules with smooth edges; in nodules with irregular, lobulated, or spiculated borders, the rate of malignancy was higher but varied across studies from 33 to 100\%. Nodules that were pure ground-glass opacities were more likely to be malignant (59 to 73\%) than solid nodules (7 to 9\%). The sensitivity of positron emission tomography imaging for identifying a malignant SPN was consistently high (80 to 100\%), whereas specificity was lower and more variable across studies (40 to 100\%). Dynamic CT with nodule enhancement yielded the most promising sensitivity (sensitivity, 98 to 100\%; specificity, 54 to 93\%) among imaging tests. In studies of CT-guided needle biopsy, nondiagnostic results were seen approximately 20\% of the time, but sensitivity and specificity were excellent when biopsy yielded a specific benign or malignant result.Conclusions: The prevalence of an SPN and the prevalence of malignancy in patients with an SPN vary widely across studies. The interpretation of these variable prevalence rates should take into consideration not only the nodule characteristics but also the population at risk. Modern imaging tests and CT-guided needle biopsy are highly sensitive for identifying a malignant SPN, but the specificity of imaging tests is variable and often poor.},

  abstract = {Out-of-domain (OOD) generalization is a significant challenge for machine learning models. Many techniques have been proposed to overcome this challenge, often focused on learning models with certain invariance properties. In this work, we draw a link between OOD performance and model calibration, arguing that calibration across multiple domains can be viewed as a special case of an invariant representation leading to better OOD generalization. Specifically, we show that under certain conditions, models which achieve \textbackslash emph\{multi-domain calibration\} are provably free of spurious correlations. This leads us to propose multi-domain calibration as a measurable and trainable surrogate for the OOD performance of a classifier. We therefore introduce methods that are easy to apply and allow practitioners to improve multi-domain calibration by training or modifying an existing model, leading to better performance on unseen domains. Using four datasets from the recently proposed WILDS OOD benchmark, as well as the Colored MNIST, we demonstrate that training or tuning models so they are calibrated across multiple domains leads to significantly improved performance on unseen test domains. We believe this intriguing connection between calibration and OOD generalization is promising from both a practical and theoretical point of view.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Kilovoltge cone beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) allows for tumor localization and response assessment during definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally  advanced NSCLC. We hypothesize that significant tumor volume loss occurs early  during radiotherapy and that the extent of volume loss correlates with clinical  outcomes. METHODS: A total of 52 patients with locally advanced NSCLC treated with  definitive chemoradiotherapy were reviewed. kV-CBCT images were used to contour  primary gross tumor volumes at four time points during treatment. Patients were  dichotomized according to absolute and relative volume changes at each time point.  Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate correlations between volume changes  and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The median gross tumor volumes were 77.1, 48.3,  42.5, and 29.9 cm(3) for fractions 1, 11, 21, and final, respectively. Greater  relative volume loss between fractions 1 and 21 correlated with improved distant  control (hazard ratio [HR]~= 0.35, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.94, p~=  0.038) and overall survival (HR~= 0.40, 95\% CI: 0.16-0.98, p~= 0.046). Greater  relative volume loss between fractions 11 and 21 correlated with improved  progression-free survival (HR~= 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.17-0.88, p~= 0.02) and trended  toward improved overall survival (HR~= 0.43, 95\% CI: 0.17-1.06, p~= 0.07). On  multivariate analysis, greater relative volume loss between fractions 11 and 21  correlated with improved progression-free survival (HR~= 0.39, 95\% CI: 0.16-0.97,  p~= 0.041) and overall survival (HR~= 0.31, 95\% CI: 0.11-0.88, p~= 0.027).  CONCLUSIONS: Significant primary tumor volume loss occurs early during radiotherapy  for locally advanced NSCLC.

  abstract = {AIM: We studied a possible action of nitric oxide (NO), an intrarenal vasodilator, to buffer a decrease in renal perfusion induced by electrical stimulation of renal nerves (RNS). METHODS: In anaesthetized rats RNS was performed (15 V, 2 ms pulse duration) for 10 s at the frequencies of 2, 3.5, 5 and 7.5 Hz. The total renal blood flow (RBF), an index of cortical perfusion, was measured using a Transonic probe on the renal artery. The outer and inner medullary blood flow (OMBF, IMBF) was measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. The effect of RNS on RBF, OMBF and IMBF was determined in rats which were either untreated or pre-treated with L-NAME (0.6 or 1.8 mg kg(-1) i.v.), or S-methyl thiocitrulline (SMTC, 20 microg kg(-1) min(-1) i.v.), a selective inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS). RESULTS: In untreated rats, RNS decreased IMBF significantly less than RBF and OMBF. High-dose L-NAME treatment significantly enhanced the RNS induced decrease of RBF but not of OMBF or IMBF. SMTC treatment significantly enhanced the decrease of IMBF, without affecting the response of RBF or OMBF. CONCLUSION: At intact NO synthesis the inner medullary circulation is not controlled by renal nerves to the extent observed for the outer medulla or cortex. NO generated by all NOS isoforms present in the kidney buffers partly the intrarenal vasoconstriction triggered by electrical RNS. The NO derived from nNOS seems of particular importance in the control of inner medullary perfusion, interacting with NO generated by endothelial NOS and renal nerves.},

Materials and Methods: We developed Synthea, an open-source software package that simulates the lifespans of synthetic patients, modeling the 10 most frequent reasons for primary care encounters and the 10 chronic conditions with the highest morbidity in the United States. Results: Synthea adheres to a previously developed conceptual framework, scales via open-source deployment on the Internet, and may be extended with additional disease and treatment modules developed by its user community. One million synthetic patient records are now freely available online, encoded in standard formats (eg, Health Level-7 [HL7] Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources [FHIR] and Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture), and accessible through an HL7 FHIR application program interface. Discussion: Health care lags other industries in information technology, data exchange, and interoperability. The lack of freely distributable health records has long hindered innovation in health care. Approaches and tools are available to inexpensively generate synthetic health records at scale without accidental disclosure risk, lowering current barriers to entry for promising early-stage developments. By engaging a growing community of users, the synthetic data generated will become increasingly comprehensive, detailed, and realistic over time. Conclusion: Synthetic patients can be simulated with models of disease progression and corresponding standards of care to produce risk-free realistic synthetic health care records at scale.},

Most methods assume that we observe all confounders, variables that affect both the causal variables and the outcome variables. This assumption is standard but it is also untestable. In this article, we develop the deconfounder, a way to do causal inference with weaker assumptions than the traditional methods require. The deconfounder is designed for problems of multiple causal inference: scientific studies that involve multiple causes whose effects are simultaneously of interest. Specifically, the deconfounder combines unsupervised machine learning and predictive model checking to use the dependencies among multiple causes as indirect evidence for some of the unobserved confounders. We develop the deconfounder algorithm, prove that it is unbiased, and show that it requires weaker assumptions than traditional causal inference. We analyze its performance in three types of studies: semi-simulated data around smoking and lung cancer, semi-simulated data around genome-wide association studies, and a real dataset about actors and movie revenue. The deconfounder is an effective approach to estimating causal effects in problems of multiple causal inference. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

However, owing to the lack of large longitudinal studies, it has been challenging to validate this link. We aimed to investigate the utility of such a gap as a risk biomarker for incident dementia using a deep learning approach for predicting brain age based on MRI-derived gray matter (GM). We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to predict brain age trained on 3,688 dementia-free participants of the Rotterdam Study (mean age 66 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 11 y, 55\% women). Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards were used to assess the association of the age gap with incident dementia, adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume, GM volume, hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities, years of education, and APOE ϵ4 allele carriership. Additionally, we computed the attention maps, which shows which regions are important for age prediction. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models showed that the age gap was significantly related to incident dementia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11 and 95\% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.05-1.16; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.11, and 95\% CI = 1.06-1.15, respectively). Attention maps indicated that GM density around the amygdala and hippocampi primarily drove the age estimation. We showed that the gap between predicted and chronological brain age is a biomarker, complimentary to those that are known, associated with risk of dementia, and could possibly be used for early-stage dementia risk screening.},

Regression parameters in these models have a conditional, subject‐specific interpretation in that they quantify regression effects for each cluster. Very often, the logistic functional shape conditional on the random effects does not carry over to the marginal scale. Thus, parameters in these models usually do not have an explicit marginal, population‐averaged interpretation. We study a bridge distribution function for the random effect in the random intercept logistic regression model. Under this distributional assumption, the marginal functional shape is still of logistic form, and thus regression parameters have an explicit marginal interpretation. The main advantage of this approach is that likelihood inference can be obtained for either marginal or conditional regression inference within a single model framework. The generality of the results and some properties of the bridge distribution functions are discussed. An example is used for illustration.}

Thirty-four patients who received an anti-PD-1 agent were in the training sample and 16 patients who received a CTLA-4 inhibitor were in the validation sample. Patients with true progressive disease (PD) were in the poor response group, and those with pseudoprogression, complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) were in the good response group. CT images were examined at baseline and after the first and second cycles of treatment, and the imaging data were extracted for radiomics modeling., Results: The radiomics model based on pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta features provided the best results for predicting response to immunotherapy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for good response indicated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.882 for the training group and an AUC of 0.857 for the validation group. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of model were 85.70\% (6/7), 66.70\% (6/9), and 75\% (12/16) for predicting a good response., Conclusion: A CT-based radiomics model for metastatic melanoma has the potential to predict early response to immunotherapy and to identify pseudoprogression.},

For example, pre-trial risk prediction algorithms such as COMPAS use ML to predict whether an individual will re-offend in the future. Our thesis is that predictive optimization raises a distinctive and serious set of normative concerns that cause it to fail on its own terms. To test this, we review 387 reports, articles, and web pages from academia, industry, non-profits, governments, and data science contests, and we find many real-world examples of predictive optimization. We select eight particularly consequential examples as case studies. Simultaneously, we develop a set of normative and technical critiques that challenge the claims made by the developers of these applications—in particular, claims of increased accuracy, efficiency, and fairness. Our key finding is that these critiques apply to each of the applications, are not easily evaded by redesigning the systems, and thus challenge whether these applications should be deployed. We argue that the burden of evidence for justifying why the deployment of predictive optimization is not harmful should rest with the developers of the tools. Based on our analysis, we provide a rubric of critical questions that can be used to deliberate or contest specific predictive optimization applications.1}

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (con-CRT) is recommended for fit patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) but is associated with  toxicity, and observed survival continues to be limited. Identifying factors  associated with early mortality could improve patient selection and identify  strategies to improve prognosis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Analysis of a  multi-institutional LA-NSCLC database consisting of 1245 patients treated with  con-CRT in 13 institutions was performed to identify factors predictive of 180-day  survival. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was performed to identify prognostic  groups for 180-day survival. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to  create a clinical nomogram predicting 180-day survival based on important predictors  from RPA. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 43.5 months (95\% confidence interval [CI]:  40.3-48.8) and 127 patients (10\%) died within 180 days of treatment. Median,  180-day, and 1- to 5-year (by yearly increments) actuarial survival rates were 20.9  months, 90\%, 71\%, 45\%, 32\%, 27\%, and 22\% respectively. Multivariate analysis  adjusted by region identified gross tumor volume (GTV) (odds ratio [OR] ≥100 cm(3):  2.61; 95\% CI: 1.10-6.20; P=.029) and pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in  1 second [FEV1], defined as the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity [FVC]) (OR  {$<$}80\%: 2.53; 95\% CI: 1.09-5.88; P=.030) as significant predictors of 180-day  survival. RPA resulted in a 2-class risk stratification system: low-risk (GTV {$<$}100  cm(3) or GTV ≥100 cm(3) and FEV1 ≥80\%) and high-risk (GTV ≥100 cm(3) and FEV1 {$<$}80\%).  The 180-day survival rates were 93\% for low risk and 79\% for high risk, with an OR  of 4.43 (95\% CI: 2.07-9.51; P{$<$}.001), adjusted by region. A clinical nomogram  predictive of 180-day survival, incorporating FEV1, GTV, N stage, and maximum  esophagus dose yielded favorable calibration (R(2) = 0.947). CONCLUSIONS: This  analysis identified several risk factors associated with early mortality and  suggests that future research in the optimization of pretreatment pulmonary function  and/or functional lung avoidance treatment may alter the therapeutic ratio in this  patient population.},

Observations               The FDA has authorized almost 1000 AI-enabled medical devices and has received hundreds of regulatory submissions for drugs that used AI in their discovery and development. Health AI regulation needs to be coordinated across all regulated industries, the US government, and with international organizations. Regulators will need to advance flexible mechanisms to keep up with the pace of change in AI across biomedicine and health care. Sponsors need to be transparent about and regulators need proficiency in evaluating the use of AI in premarket development. A life cycle management approach incorporating recurrent local postmarket performance monitoring should be central to health AI development. Special mechanisms to evaluate large language models and their uses are needed. Approaches are necessary to balance the needs of the entire spectrum of health ecosystem interests, from large firms to start-ups.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cavitary lung cancers typically show thick-walled cavities on radiology, thin-walled cancers have recently been reported. However, the prognostic  and pathologic differences between thin-walled and thick-walled variants are  unclear. We reviewed detailed histologic features and survival outcomes of cavitary  pulmonary adenocarcinomas to assess pathologic attributes, focusing particularly on  cavity wall thickness. METHODS: We studied 132 patients diagnosed with  lung~adenocarcinoma involving cavitary formation, as determined with high-resolution  computed tomography or histology, between 1998 and 2007. Using receiver-operating  characteristics curve analysis, we established a cutoff value for cavity wall  thickness based on disease-specific survival. Cavitary adenocarcinomas were grouped  into thick-walled or thin-walled types according to this cutoff, as measured by  computed tomography. RESULTS: The thick-walled group comprised lung adenocarcinoma  patients with a cavity wall thickness of greater than 4 mm (n~= 65); the thin-walled  group comprised patients with a cavity wall thickness of 4 mm or~less (n~= 67). The  thick-walled group had a higher frequency of solid predominant tumors (p {$<$} 0.01),  vascular invasion (p {$<$} 0.001), lymphatic invasion (p {$<$} 0.01), necrosis (p {$<$} 0.001),  obstructive pneumonia (p {$<$} 0.01), intracavity abscess (p {$<$} 0.01), and bronchiolar  obstruction (p~= 0.02). Lepidic predominant (p~= 0.09) and papillary predominant  patterns (p~= 0.08) were more common in the thin-walled group. Multivariate analysis  revealed cavity wall thickness to be an independent prognostic factor (p~= 0.022).  CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic and prognostic implications of thick-walled cavities  versus thin-walled cavities in lung carcinoma patients, defined according to our  cutoff, were found to be distinct.},

  abstract = {The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph representing causal pathways for informing the conduct of an observational study. The use of DAGs allows transparent communication of a causal model between researchers and can prevent over-adjustment biases when conducting causal inference, permitting greater confidence and transparency in reported causal estimates. In the era of ‘big data’ and increasing number of observational studies, the role of the DAG is becoming more important. Recent best-practice guidance for constructing a DAG with reference to the literature has been published in the ‘Evidence synthesis for constructing DAGs’ (ESC-DAG) protocol. We aimed to assess adherence to these principles for DAGs constructed within perioperative literature. Following registration on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting framework for systematic reviews, we searched the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Cochrane databases for perioperative observational research incorporating a DAG. Nineteen studies were included in the final synthesis. No studies demonstrated any evidence of following the mapping stage of the protocol. Fifteen (79\%) fulfilled over half of the translation and integration one stages of the protocol. Adherence with one stage did not guarantee fulfilment of the other. Two studies (11\%) undertook the integration two stage. Unmeasured variables were handled inconsistently between studies. Only three (16\%) studies included unmeasured variables within their DAG and acknowledged their implication within the main text. Overall, DAGs that were constructed for use in perioperative observational literature did not consistently adhere to best practice, potentially limiting the benefits of subsequent causal inference. Further work should focus on exploring reasons for this deviation and increasing methodological transparency around DAG construction.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Biomarkers for outcome after immune-checkpoint blockade are strongly needed as these may influence individual treatment selection or sequence. We aimed to identify baseline factors associated with overall survival (OS) after pembrolizumab treatment in melanoma patients. Experimental Design: Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), routine blood count parameters, and clinical characteristics were investigated in 616 patients. Endpoints were OS and best overall response following pembrolizumab treatment. Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox regression were applied for survival analysis. Results: Relative eosinophil count (REC) ≥1.5\%, relative lymphocyte count (RLC) ≥17.5\%, ≤2.5-fold elevation of LDH, and the absence of metastasis other than soft-tissue/lung were associated with favorable OS in the discovery (n = 177) and the confirmation (n = 182) cohort and had independent positive impact (all P {$<$} 0.001). Their independent role was subsequently confirmed in the validation cohort (n = 257; all P {$<$} 0.01). The number of favorable factors was strongly associated with prognosis. One-year OS probabilities of 83.9\% versus 14.7\% and response rates of 58.3\% versus 3.3\% were observed in patients with four of four compared to those with none of four favorable baseline factors present, respectively. Conclusions: High REC and RLC, low LDH, and absence of metastasis other than soft-tissue/lung are independent baseline characteristics associated with favorable OS of patients with melanoma treated with pembrolizumab. Presence of four favorable factors in combination identifies a subgroup with excellent prognosis. In contrast, patients with no favorable factors present have a poor prognosis, despite pembrolizumab, and additional treatment advances are still needed. A potential predictive impact needs to be further investigated. Clin Cancer Res; 22(22); 5487–96. ©2016 AACR.},

Following kidney injection with PRV, the animals survived 4-day post-inoculation prior to sacrifice and tissue processing. PRV-infected neurons that double-stained for nNOS were found in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), the raphe obscurus nucleus (ROb), the ventromedial medulla (VMM), the rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM) and the A5 cell group. In the thoracolumbar spinal cord, nNOS neurons co-localized with PRV-infected cells in the dorsal horn in laminae I, III-V ipsilateral to the injected kidney and in lamina X, the intermediolateral cell column, the lateral funiculus, the intercalated nucleus and the central autonomic area. We conclude that NO synthesizing cells may significantly affect renal autonomic pathways in the rat by interacting with the renal sensory and sympathomotor circuitry at multiple sites.},

  abstract = {Colonic diverticular disease is a common condition, and around a quarter of people affected by it will experience acute symptoms at some time. The most common presentation is uncomplicated acute diverticulitis that can be managed conservatively with bowel rest and antibiotics. However, some patients will present with diverticular abscesses or purulent or faeculent peritonitis due to perforated diverticular disease. Whilst most mesocolic abscesses can be managed with percutaneous drainage alone, pelvic abscesses are associated with a higher rate of future complications and usually require percutaneous drainage followed by interval sigmoid resection. Patients who require emergency surgery for complicated acute diverticulitis most commonly undergo a Hartmann’s procedure, although resection with primary anastomosis and laparoscopic peritoneal lavage have emerged as alternative treatment options for patients with purulent peritonitis in recent years. However, robust evidence from randomized trials is lacking for these alternative procedures, and the studies that have reported good outcomes from them have included carefully selected patient groups. There has been a move away from recommending elective prophylactic colectomy after two episodes of acute diverticulitis in the light of evidence that most patients will not experience a significant recurrence of their symptoms; elective surgery is indicated for those with ongoing symptoms, pelvic abscesses, complications—such as fistulating disease, strictures or recurrent diverticular bleeding—and those who are at high risk of perforation during future episodes, for example, due to immunosuppression, chronic renal failure or collagen-vascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: There are many clinical prediction models (CPMs) available to inform treatment decisions for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, the extent to which they have been externally tested, and how well they generally perform has not been broadly evaluated. Methods: A SCOPUS citation search was run on March 22, 2017 to identify external validations of cardiovascular CPMs in the Tufts Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness CPM Registry. We assessed the extent of external validation, performance heterogeneity across databases, and explored factors associated with model performance, including a global assessment of the clinical relatedness between the derivation and validation data. Results: We identified 2030 external validations of 1382 CPMs. Eight hundred seven (58\%) of the CPMs in the Registry have never been externally validated. On average, there were 1.5 validations per CPM (range, 0–94). The median external validation area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.73 (25th–75th percentile [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.66–0.79), representing a median percent decrease in discrimination of −11.1\% (IQR, −32.4\% to +2.7\%) compared with performance on derivation data. 81\% (n=1333) of validations reporting area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed discrimination below that reported in the derivation dataset. 53\% (n=983) of the validations report some measure of CPM calibration. For CPMs evaluated more than once, there was typically a large range of performance. Of 1702 validations classified by relatedness, the percent change in discrimination was −3.7\% (IQR, −13.2 to 3.1) for closely related validations (n=123), −9.0 (IQR, −27.6 to 3.9) for related validations (n=862), and −17.2\% (IQR, −42.3 to 0) for distantly related validations (n=717; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Many published cardiovascular CPMs have never been externally validated, and for those that have, apparent performance during development is often overly optimistic. A single external validation appears insufficient to broadly understand the performance heterogeneity across different settings.}

Our objective in this Review was to assess machine learning alternatives to logistic regression which may accomplish the same goals but with fewer assumptions or greater accuracy. Study Design and Setting We identified alternative methods for propensity score estimation and/or classification from the public health, biostatistics, discrete mathematics, and computer science literature, and evaluated these algorithms for applicability to the problem of propensity score estimation, potential advantages over logistic regression, and ease of use. Results We identified four techniques as alternatives to logistic regression: neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees (CART), and meta-classifiers (in particular, boosting). Conclusion While the assumptions of logistic regression are well understood, those assumptions are frequently ignored. All four alternatives have advantages and disadvantages compared with logistic regression. Boosting (meta-classifiers) and to a lesser extent decision trees (particularly CART) appear to be most promising for use in the context of propensity score analysis, but extensive simulation studies are needed to establish their utility in practice.},

  abstract = {We describe an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP) ST258 that occurred in two institutions (a hospital and a nursing home) in the Netherlands between July and December 2013. In total, six patients were found to be positive for KPC-KP. All isolates were resistant to colistin and exhibited reduced susceptibility to gentamicin and tigecycline. In all settings, extensive environmental contamination was found. Whole genome sequencing revealed the presence of bla KPC-2 and bla SHV-12 genes, as well as the close relatedness of patient and environmental isolates. In the hospital setting, one transmission was detected, despite contact precautions. After upgrading to strict isolation, no further spread was found. After the transfer of the index patient to a nursing home in the same region, four further transmissions occurred. The outbreak in the nursing home was controlled by transferring all KPC-KP-positive residents to a separate location outside the nursing home, where a dedicated nursing team cared for patients. This outbreak illustrates that the spread of pan-resistant Enterobacteriaceae can be controlled, but may be difficult, particularly in long-term care facilities. It, therefore, poses a major threat to patient safety. Clear guidelines to control reservoirs in and outside the hospitals are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {When missing data occur in one or more covariates in a regression model, multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete-case analysis (CC). We use theoretical arguments and simulation studies to compare these methods with MI implemented under a missing at random assumption. When data are missing completely at random, both methods have negligible bias, and MI is more efficient than CC across a wide range of scenarios. For other missing data mechanisms, bias arises in one or both methods. In our simulation setting, CC is biased towards the null when data are missing at random. However, when missingness is independent of the outcome given the covariates, CC has negligible bias and MI is biased away from the null. With more general missing data mechanisms, bias tends to be smaller for MI than for CC. Since MI is not always better than CC for missing covariate problems, the choice of method should take into account what is known about the missing data mechanism in a particular substantive application. Importantly, the choice of method should not be based on comparison of standard errors. We propose new ways to understand empirical differences between MI and CC, which may provide insights into the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying each method, and we propose a new index for assessing the likely gain in precision from MI: the fraction of incomplete cases among the observed values of a covariate (FICO).

METHODS: We retrieved, from the SEER database, data on demographics,  disease extension (size, extent of primary tumor, and nodal status), histology,  primary treatment modality, and survival time of NSCLC cases diagnosed between 1998  and 2003 (n = 138,063). Cases were reclassified into separate T4 (satellite,  invasive, or pleural effusion) and M1 (ipsilateral, contralateral, or distant)  categories based on the extent of the primary tumor and the location of metastatic  disease. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the effects  of each variable on survival. RESULTS: For stage IIIB NSCLC, T4 satellite had the  best prognosis (comparable to T2 lesions), followed by T4 invasive and T4 pleural  effusion. For stage IV, M1 ipsilateral had the best prognosis, followed by M1  contralateral and M1 distant. Nodal status remained a powerful determinant of  survival, particularly for patients with T4 satellite, T4 invasive, M1 ipsilateral,  and, to a less extent, M1 contralateral. Other prognostic variables were identified  within each subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: In this report, we present the most comprehensive  analysis performed to date of patients with stage IIIB and IV NSCLC enrolled in the  SEER program. The survival trends observed here suggest that T4 satellite lung  cancer cases should be redefined as T2b, and not T3 as recently proposed for the  upcoming TNM classification, seventh edition.},

Privatised space travel exposes non-professional astronauts with health profiles comprising underlying conditions to microgravity. Prior research has typically focused on the effects of microgravity on human physiology in healthy astronauts, and little is known how the effects of microgravity may play out in the pathophysiology of underlying medical conditions, such as heart failure. This study used an established, controlled lumped mathematical model of the cardiopulmonary system to simulate the effects of entry into microgravity in the setting of heart failure with both, reduced and preserved ejection fraction. We find that exposure to microgravity eventuates an increased cardiac output, and in patients with heart failure there is an unwanted increase in left atrial pressure, indicating an elevated risk for development of pulmonary oedema. This model gives insight into the risks of space flight for people with heart failure, and the impact this may have on mission success in space tourism.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Acute renal denervation during POD 1–2 h after relief of BUO had no effect on glomerular filtration rate of sodium, potassium, water, or solute excretion, in contrast with its natriuretic and diuretic effect in sham-operated rats. Intravenous furosemide or acute saline loading caused a further marked increase in sodium and water excretion during POD, demonstrating the ability of the kidney undergoing POD to respond to other types of natriuretic stimuli. Chronic renal denervation prior to BUO had no effect on subsequent POD. The lack of response of the BUO kidney undergoing POD to acute denervation contrasts with the changes in renal function following denervation of the unilateral postobstructive kidney. The results indicate that the kidney undergoing POD after relief of BUO may be functionally denervated and suggest that inhibition of renal nerve activity could contribute to the pathophysiology of POD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: At the age of 18 years, jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt (1910-1953) sustained significant burns to his left-hand ring and little fingers; yet, subsequently, he relearned to play and achieved international fame, despite his injuries. CASE DESCRIPTION AND METHODS: Archive film footage and novel motion analysis software were used to compare movements of Django's fretting hand with that of six other guitarists of the same genre. FINDINGS AND OUTCOMES: Django employed greater abduction of index and middle fingers (-9.11 ± 6.52° vs -5.78 ± 2.41°; p {$<$} 0.001) and more parallel alignment of fingers to the guitar neck (157.7 ± 3.37° vs 150.59 ± 2.67°; p {$<$} 0.001) compared to controls. CONCLUSION: In response to debilitating hand injury, Django developed quantifiable compensatory adaptation of function of his remaining functional fingers by developing an original playing technique. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Hand function following injury may be optimized by maximizing latent degrees of freedom in remaining digits, rather than through extensive surgical reconstruction or complex prostheses. Further study of adaptation strategies may inform prosthesis design.},

  abstract = {Anatomical studies have demonstrated sympathetic innervation of the renal arterioles, juxtaglomerular apparatus, and renal tubules. Physiologic studies of the effects of the renal efferent nerves on renin release and renal sodium handling indicate that they play an important role in body fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular regulation. In addition, evidence is accumulating that stimulation of intrarenal mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors causes in increase in renal afferent nerve activity and that alterations in renal afferent nerve traffic are, in turn, associated with changes in blood pressure and in vasoconstrictor tone in the contralateral kidney. Further, recent studies have demonstrated functionally significant connections between renal afferent nerves and the central nervous system. Interruption of the renal sympathetic nerves has been shown to prevent or attenuate hypertension in a number of animal models, suggesting that the renal nerves have an important role in the pathogenesis of experimental hypertension. In the spontaneously hypertensive rate of the Okamoto strain (SHR) and the DOCA-NaCl rat, the delay in the development of hypertension produced by renal denervation is due in part to increased sodium excretion thought to be secondary to interruption of the renal efferent nerves. In contrast, in one-kidney, one clip and two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertension in the rat and coarctation hypertension in the dog, the depressor effect of renal denervation is unrelated to changes in urinary sodium excretion or plasma renin activity. In these models the attenuation of hypertension following renal denervation appears to be secondary to a decrease in peripheral sympathetic activity. Evidence in the one-kidney model suggests that interruption of the renal afferent nerves lower blood pressure via an effect on central noradrenergic mechanisms.},

Two questions arise: 1) will diverticulosis progress in the proximal colon if only the sigmoid is removed, and 2) will diverticulitis recur in the more proximal diverticula? To evaluate these potential problems, the histories were reviewed of 61 patients who had elective sigmoid resection for diverticular disease and who had bariumenema examinations before operation, early during the postoperative period, and at least five years later. Progression of diverticulosis was noted in only nine (14.7 per cent) patients on repeat barium-enema examination five to nine years after resection; the progression was noted to be minimal in all nine. Seven patients (11.4 per cent) had signs and symptoms of recurrent diverticulitis. Only three patients demonstrated progression of diverticulosis and recurrent diverticulitis. We see no benefit in resecting all of the diverticula-bearing colon after adequate sigmoid resection, as there is minimal progression in the diverticular process and the risk of recurrence is low.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The selection of patients for oligometastasis-directed ablative therapy remains a challenge. The authors report on clinical and molecular predictors of survival from a stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) dose-escalation trial for oligometastases. METHODS: Patients who had from 1 to 5 metastases, a life expectancy of {$>$}3 months, and a Karnofsky performance status of {$>$}60 received escalating SBRT doses to all known cancer sites. Time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were calculated at the completion of SBRT, and clinical predictors of OS were modeled. Primary tumor microRNA expression was analyzed to identify molecular predictors of OS. RESULTS: Sixty-one evaluable patients were enrolled from 2004 to 2009. The median follow-up was 2.3 years for all patients (range, 0.2-9.3 years) and 6.8 years for survivors (range, 2.0-9.3 years). The median, 2-year, and 5-year estimated OS were 2.4 years, 57\%, and 32\%, respectively. The rate of progression after SBRT was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.82). The time from initial cancer diagnosis to metastasis (HR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.98-0.99), the time from metastasis to SBRT (HR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.98-0.99), and breast cancer histology (HR, 0.12; 95\% CI, 0.07-0.37) were significant predictors of OS. In an exploratory analysis, a candidate classifier using expression levels of 3 microRNAs (miR-23b, miR-449a, and miR-449b) predicted survival among 17 patients who had primary tumor microRNA expression data available. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of oligometastatic patients achieves long-term survival after metastasis-directed SBRT. Clinical features and primary tumor microRNA expression profiling, if validated in an independent dataset, may help select oligometastatic patients most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.

VE in diabetic rats increased (P \&lt; 0.001) cumulative urine sodium excretion (CuU(Na)V) to 104 +/- 9 and 69 +/- 6 micromol min(-1) (g kidney wt)(-1) in the denervated and in the innervated kidneys, respectively, which were both less (P \&lt; 0.001) than in the non-diabetic rats, at 225 +/- 14 and 148 +/- 14 micromol min(-1) (g kidney wt)(-1), respectively, in the denervated and the innervated kidney. The non-selective NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME) given to the diabetic rats with intact renal innervation enhanced CuU(Na)V after VE by 43 \% (P \&lt; 0.001), while the combination of L-NAME and renal denervation restored CuU(Na)V to a value comparable to that of non-diabetic rats. In diabetic rats treated with either a relatively selective inhibitor for the neuronal isoform of NOS, 7-nitroindazole, or a relatively selective inhibitor for the inducible isoform of NOS, aminoguanidine, CuU(Na)V after VE was similar to the untreated diabetic rats irrespective of whether or not the renal nerves were present. This investigation demonstrated that NO production contributed, at least partly, to the depressed ability to excrete a saline load in diabetes mellitus. The endothelial isoform of NOS was most probably responsible for generating NO which caused the blunted excretory responses. The ability of NO to attenuate the excretory responses to volume expansion was an action independent of the renal innervation status. Experimental Physiology (2001) 86.4, 481-488.},

Adoption into clinical practice is lagging, in large part due to disconnects between how ML practitioners evaluate models and what is required for their successful integration into care delivery. Models are just one component of care delivery workflows whose constraints determine clinicians’ abilities to act on models’ outputs. However, methods to evaluate the usefulness of models in the context of their corresponding workflows are currently limited. To bridge this gap we developed APLUS, a reusable framework for quantitatively assessing via simulation the utility gained from integrating a model into a clinical workflow. We describe the APLUS simulation engine and workflow specification language, and apply it to evaluate a novel ML-based screening pathway for detecting peripheral artery disease at Stanford Health Care.},

  abstract = {Prognostic information at diagnosis has important implications for cancer treatment and monitoring. Although cancer staging, histopathological assessment, molecular features, and clinical variables can provide useful prognostic insights, improving risk stratification remains an active research area. We developed a deep learning system (DLS) to predict disease specific survival across 10 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used a weakly-supervised approach without pixel-level annotations, and tested three different survival loss functions. The DLS was developed using 9,086 slides from 3,664 cases and evaluated using 3,009 slides from 1,216 cases. In multivariable Cox regression analysis of the combined cohort including all 10 cancers, the DLS was significantly associated with disease specific survival (hazard ratio of 1.58, 95\% CI 1.28-1.70, p{$<$}0.0001) after adjusting for cancer type, stage, age, and sex. In a per-cancer adjusted subanalysis, the DLS remained a significant predictor of survival in 5 of 10 cancer types. Compared to a baseline model including stage, age, and sex, the c-index of the model demonstrated an absolute 3.7\% improvement (95\% CI 1.0-6.5) in the combined cohort. Additionally, our models stratified patients within individual cancer stages, particularly stage II (p=0.025) and stage III (p{$<$}0.001). By developing and evaluating prognostic models across multiple cancer types, this work represents one of the most comprehensive studies exploring the direct prediction of clinical outcomes using deep learning and histopathology images. Our analysis demonstrates the potential for this approach to provide prognostic information in multiple cancer types, and even within specific pathologic stages. However, given the relatively small number of clinical events, we observed wide confidence intervals, suggesting that future work will benefit from larger datasets.},

METHODS AND  MATERIALS: In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, we  analyzed the pretreatment FDG-PET and CT scans of 44 lung cancer patients treated  with radiation therapy. A novel, intratumor partitioning method was developed, based  on a 2-stage clustering process: first at the patient level, each tumor was  over-segmented into many superpixels by k-means clustering of integrated PET and CT  images; next, tumor subregions were identified by merging previously defined  superpixels via population-level hierarchical clustering. The volume associated with  each of the subregions was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis regarding its  prognostic capability in predicting overall survival (OS) and out-of-field  progression (OFP). RESULTS: Three spatially distinct subregions were identified  within each tumor that were highly robust to uncertainty in PET/CT co-registration.  Among these, the volume of the most metabolically active and metabolically  heterogeneous solid component of the tumor was predictive of OS and OFP on the  entire cohort, with a concordance index or CI of 0.66-0.67. When restricting the  analysis to patients with stage III disease (n=32), the same subregion achieved an  even higher CI of 0.75 (hazard ratio 3.93, log-rank P=.002) for predicting OS, and a  CI of 0.76 (hazard ratio 4.84, log-rank P=.002) for predicting OFP. In comparison,  conventional imaging markers, including tumor volume, maximum standardized uptake  value, and metabolic tumor volume using threshold of 50\% standardized uptake value  maximum, were not predictive of OS or OFP, with CI mostly below 0.60 (log-rank  P{$>$}.05). CONCLUSION: We propose a robust intratumor partitioning method to identify  clinically relevant, high-risk subregions in lung cancer. We envision that this  approach will be~applicable to identifying useful imaging biomarkers in many cancer  types.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review and appraise the validity and usefulness of published and preprint reports of prediction models for diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in patients with suspected infection, for prognosis of patients with covid-19, and for detecting people in the general population at increased risk of covid-19 infection or being admitted to hospital with the disease. DESIGN: Living systematic review and critical appraisal by the COVID-PRECISE (Precise Risk Estimation to optimise covid-19 Care for Infected or Suspected patients in diverse sEttings) group. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase through Ovid, up to 1 July 2020, supplemented with arXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 5 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. DATA EXTRACTION: At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). RESULTS: 37\,421 titles were screened, and 169 studies describing 232 prediction models were included. The review identified seven models for identifying people at risk in the general population; 118 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (75 were based on medical imaging, 10 to diagnose disease severity); and 107 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, intensive care unit admission, ventilation, intubation, or length of hospital stay. The most frequent types of predictors included in the covid-19 prediction models are vital signs, age, comorbidities, and image features. Flu-like symptoms are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while sex, C reactive protein, and lymphocyte counts are frequent prognostic factors. Reported C index estimates from the strongest form of validation available per model ranged from 0.71 to 0.99 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.54 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and unclear reporting. Many models did not include a description of the target population (n=27, 12\%) or care setting (n=75, 32\%), and only 11 (5\%) were externally validated by a calibration plot. The Jehi diagnostic model and the 4C mortality score were identified as promising models. CONCLUSION: Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that almost all pubished prediction models are poorly reported, and at high risk of bias such that their reported predictive performance is probably optimistic. However, we have identified two (one diagnostic and one prognostic) promising models that should soon be validated in multiple cohorts, preferably through collaborative efforts and data sharing to also allow an investigation of the stability and heterogeneity in their performance across populations and settings. Details on all reviewed models are publicly available at https://www.covprecise.org/. Methodological guidance as provided in this paper should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, prediction model authors should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We studied whether maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) from [18\,F] PET/CT predict clinical outcome after concurrent proton/chemotherapy for stage III  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Eighty-four patients were treated  prospectively with 74\,Gy(RBE) proton therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. PET/CT  scans were available before (SUV1) and within 6\,months after (SUV2) treatment. The  predictive value of clinical and PET/CT factors were analyzed with univariate and  multivariate Cox regression models. RESULTS: Median survival time was 29.9\,months.  At 3\,years, the local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rate was 34.8\%; distant  metastasis-free survival (DMFS), 35.4\%; progression-free survival (PFS), 31.2\%; and  overall survival (OS), 37.2\%. Patients with SUV2 ≥3.6 (the median) had high rates of  LR (p\,=\,0.021). Of 12 clinicopathologic features evaluated in univariate analysis,  only KPS, SUV1, and SUV2 predicted LRFS, DMFS, PFS, and OS (p {$<$}0.05). Multivariate  analysis showed that KPS (p\,=\,0.025) and SUV2 (p\,=\,0.017) were independently  prognostic for LRFS and that SUV1, SUV2, and KPS were independently prognostic for  DMFS, PFS, and OS (p {$<$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUV2 predicted LRFS, and SUV1 and SUV2  predicted DMFS, PFS, and OS, in patients with stage III NSCLC treated with  concurrent chemotherapy and high-dose proton therapy.},

  abstract = {Electrocardiograms (ECG) provide an effective, non-invasive approach for clinical diagnosis and monitoring treatment in patients with cardiac diseases including the most common cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF). Portable ECG recording devices including Apple Watch and Kardia devices have been developed for AF detection. However, the efficacy of these smart devices has not been fully validated. We aimed to develop an open-source deep learning framework for automatic AF detection using the largest publicly available single-lead ECG dataset through a mobile Kardia device enhanced with style transfer-driven data augmentation. We developed and validated a 37-layer convolutional recurrent network (CRN) using 5,834 single-lead ECGs with a mean length of 30 seconds from the 2017 PhysioNet Challenge to automatically detect sinus rhythm and AF. To address the challenge of a lack of a large number of AF samples, we proposed a novel style transfer generator that fuses patient-specific clinical ECGs and mathematically modelled ECG features to synthesize realistic ECGs by five-fold. The differences between synthesized and clinical ECGs were analyzed by studying their average ECG morphologies and frequency distributions. Our results indicated the style transfer-driven data augmentation was not classifier-dependent. Validation on 2,917 clinical ECGs showed an F1 score of 96.4\%, with the generated ECGs contributing to a 3\% improvement in AF detection for the Kardia event recorder. By developing and evaluating our approach on an open-source ECG dataset, we have demonstrated that our framework is both robust and verifiable, and potentially can be used in portable devices for effective AF classification.},

  abstract = {SNS (sympathetic nervous system) activation is a common feature of arterial hypertension and has been demonstrated to contribute to the development and progression of the hypertensive state. Persuasive evidence suggests a strong association between SNS overactivity and variety of disease states, including chronic renal failure, insulin resistance, congestive heart failure, sleep apnoea, ventricular arrhythmias and others. Although sympatholytic agents are available to target SNS overactivity pharmacologically, they are not widely used in clinical practice, leaving the SNS unopposed in many patients. The recent introduction of catheter-based renal denervation as an alternative approach to target the SNS therapeutically has been demonstrated to result in a clinically relevant blood pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension, presumably through its effects on both efferent and afferent renal nerve traffic. Available data on this interventional procedure demonstrate a favourable vascular and renal safety profile. Preliminary data obtained primarily from small and mostly uncontrolled studies in related disease states often characterized by overactivity of the SNS are promising, but require confirmation in appropriately designed clinical trials. In the present paper, we briefly review the physiology of the renal nerves and their role in hypertension and other relevant disease states, summarize the data currently available from clinical studies pertaining to the safety and efficacy of renal denervation in resistant hypertension, discuss potential future implications and the available data supporting such a role for renal denervation, and describe some of the newer devices currently under investigation to achieve improved blood pressure control via renal denervation.}

  abstract = {Background Evidence regarding the association between sarcopenia (skeletal muscle depletion) and outcomes in patients with lung cancer varies across studies. We aimed to systematically review the prognostic value of sarcopenia in lung cancer. Methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through July 23, 2018 to identify retrospective or prospective cohort studies. We applied the Quality in Prognostic Studies instrument to assess the risk of bias in individual studies. We examined the heterogeneity and publication bias and performed subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Results We included 13 studies (1,810 participants). The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia was 43\%~in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 52\%~in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Sarcopenia was associated with a shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 2.23; 95\%~CI, 1.68-2.94). This association existed for both NSCLC (HR, 2.57; 95\%~CI, 1.79-3.68) and SCLC (HR, 1.59; 95\%~CI, 1.17-2.14). Sarcopenia was an independent predictor of shorter OS in both stage I-II NSCLC (HR, 3.23; 95\%~CI, 1.68-6.23) and stage III-IV NSCLC (HR, 2.19; 95\%~CI, 1.14-4.24). However, sarcopenia was not an independent predictor of disease-free survival in patients with NSCLC (HR, 1.28; 95\%~CI, 0.44-3.69). Conclusions Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients with lung cancer (approximately one in two) and an important predictor of impaired OS in patients with SCLC or with different stages of NSCLC.},

The algorithm was incorporated into the electronic health record (EHR) to automatically screen for low EF, encouraging clinicians to obtain a confirmatory transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for previously undiagnosed patients, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment. Objectives To prospectively evaluate a novel artificial intelligence (AI) screening tool for detecting low EF in primary care practices. Design The EAGLE trial is a pragmatic two-arm cluster randomized trial (NCT04000087) that will randomize {$>$}100 clinical teams (i.e., clusters) to either intervention (access to the new AI screening tool) or control (usual care) at 48 primary care practices across Minnesota and Wisconsin. The trial is expected to involve approximately 400 clinicians and 20,000 patients. The primary endpoint is newly discovered EF ≤50\%. Eligible patients will include adults who undergo ECG for any reason and have not been previously diagnosed with low EF. Data will be pulled from the EHR, and no contact will be made with patients. A positive deviance qualitative study and a post-implementation survey will be conducted among select clinicians to identify facilitators and barriers to using the new screening report. Summary This trial will examine the effectiveness of the AI-enabled ECG for detection of asymptomatic low EF in routine primary care practices and will be among the first to prospectively evaluate the value of AI in real-world practice. Its findings will inform future implementation strategies for the translation of other AI-enabled algorithms.}

Despite recent progress in identifying latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity (T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios, including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis, demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for causal downstream tasks.},

Downregulation of nNOS and IL-1beta, two modulators of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity may mediate this activation. In this study we measured the effects of intrarenal phenol injection on peripheral SNS activity by direct renal nerve recording, plasma NE, nNOS, and IL-1beta abundance in the brain. We also determined whether renal denervation or administration of clonidine prevented these effects of phenol. Acutely, the phenol injection increased both afferent and efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and increased plasma NE. Three weeks after the phenol injection, BP and plasma NE remained elevated. Renal denervation and pretreatment with clonidine prevented the increase in BP and plasma NE caused by phenol. Chronic renal injury caused by phenol was associated with decreased abundance of IL-1beta and nNOS in the PH. These studies have shown that a renal injury caused by phenol injection increases BP and central as well as peripheral SNS activity, which persist long after the injury. Renal denervation and antiadrenergic drugs abolish the effects of phenol on BP and plasma NE. Because NO and IL-1beta modulate SNS activity, the stimulatory action of phenol on the SNS could be mediated by downregulation of nNOS and IL-1beta in the brain.}

  abstract = {Objective Lobectomy is considered optimal therapy for early-stage non–small cell lung cancer, but sublobar wedge resection and stereotactic body radiation therapy are alternative treatments. This study compared outcomes between wedge resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy. Methods Overall survival of patients with cT1N0 and tumors ≤2~cm who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy or wedge resection in the National Cancer Data Base from 2008 to 2011 was assessed via a Kaplan-Meier and propensity score–matched analysis. A center-level sensitivity analysis that used observed/expected mortality ratios was conducted to identify an association between center use of stereotactic body radiotherapy and mortality. Results Of the 6295 patients included, 1778 (28.2\%) underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy, and 4517 (71.8\%) underwent wedge resection. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was associated with significantly reduced 5-year survival compared with wedge resection in both unmatched analysis (30.9\% vs 55.2\%, P~{$<~$}.001) and after adjustment for covariates (31.0\% vs 49.9\%, P~{$<~$}.001). Stereotactic body radiotherapy also was associated with worse overall survival than wedge resection after 2 subgroup analyses of propensity-matched patients (P~{$<~$}.05 for both). Centers that used stereotactic body radiotherapy more often as opposed to surgery for patients with cT1N0 patients with tumors {$<$}2~cm were more likely to have an observed/expected mortality ratio {$>$} 1 for 3-year mortality (P~=~.034). Conclusions In this national analysis, wedge resection was associated with better survival for stage IA non–small cell lung cancer than stereotactic body radiotherapy.},

The early  identification of patients with poor prognosis is the premise of personalized  treatment for patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of  clinical parameters and primary tumor SUV(max) on pre-treatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT in  patients with stage iii NSCLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical records of 79 stage  iii-NSCLC patients with pre-treatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging, treated with  definitive CCRT were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical endpoints in terms of  progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were correlated with the  median pre-treatment primary tumor SUV(max). Furthermore, other factors influencing  patient outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 58 years  (range, 45-71) with 72 (91\%) males. Squamous cell carcinoma (73\%) was the most  common histologic type. Performance status was very good (ECOG 0) in 64.5\% of  patients. Sixty (79\%) patients had died at the time of this analysis. Median OS and  PFS were 22.5 and 12.0 months, respectively. Patients were dichotomized according to  pre-treatment primary tumor SUV(max)≤15.0 vs.{$>$}15.0. There was no statistically  significant difference for OS and PFS in both arms. Multivariate analysis showed  that pre-treatment SUV(max) was not a significant predictor of OS (HR 1.099,  P=0.726) and PFS (HR 1.022, P=0.941). CONCLUSIONS: SUV(max) with threshold value of  15.0 on the primary tumor before treatment had no prognostic value in our patient  group with stage iii NSCLC treated with definitive CCRT.},

We selected 37 unresectable NSCLC  patients with adjacent great vessel invasion (GVI) by carefully reviewing each  patient's images. The criteria of definite GVI were as follows: irregular  indentation at the tumor-vessel contact border, slit-like narrowing of adjacent  great vessels by the tumor, presence of intra-luminal mass formation, tumors  contacting {$>$}5 cm of adjacent great vessel and obliteration of the intervening fat  plane between tumor and adjacent great vessel, and/or tumors contacting more than  half of the circumference of the aortic wall. All of the patients completed the  CCRT, of which the median dose was 66.0 Gy (range, 59.4-72.0 Gy) with 1.8 or 2.0 Gy  per fraction. The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate for total patients was 48.2\%.  Early nodal staging (P = 0.006) and good performance status (P = 0.044) were  identified as independent prognostic factors associated with better OS. There was no  fatal complication related to the GVI, such as a sudden death or massive hemoptysis  due to vascular rupture after CCRT. We concluded that definitive CCRT for NSCLC  patients with GVI on radiological findings has a low risk of fatal complication and  it can benefit long-term survival when treated with CCRT in patients with early  nodal staging or good performance status.},

  abstract = {External validation is often recommended to ensure the generalizability of ML models. However, it neither guarantees generalizability nor equates to a model's clinical usefulness (the ultimate goal of any clinical decision-support tool). External validation is misaligned with current healthcare ML needs. First, patient data changes across time, geography, and facilities. These changes create significant volatility in the performance of a single fixed model (especially for deep learning models, which dominate clinical ML). Second, newer ML techniques, current market forces, and updated regulatory frameworks are enabling frequent updating and monitoring of individual deployed model instances. We submit that external validation is insufficient to establish ML models' safety or utility. Proposals to fix the external validation paradigm do not go far enough. Continued reliance on it as the ultimate test is likely to lead us astray. We propose the MLOps-inspired paradigm of recurring local validation as an alternative that ensures the validity of models while protecting against performance-disruptive data variability. This paradigm relies on site-specific reliability tests before every deployment, followed by regular and recurrent checks throughout the life cycle of the deployed algorithm. Initial and recurrent reliability tests protect against performance-disruptive distribution shifts, and concept drifts that jeopardize patient safety.},

Aim The aim of this study was to develop and validate a radiomics nomogram by incorporating the pretreatment contrast-enhanced Computed tomography (CT) images and clinical risk factors to estimate the anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients. Methods A total of 58 patients with advanced HCC who were refractory to the standard first-line of therapy, and received PD-1 inhibitor treatment with Toripalimab, Camrelizumab, or Sintilimab from 1st January 2019 to 31 July 2020 were enrolled and divided into two sets randomly: training set (n = 40) and validation set (n = 18). Radiomics features were extracted from non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced CT scans and selected by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Finally, a radiomics nomogram was developed based on by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. Results Eight radiomics features from the whole tumor and peritumoral regions were selected and comprised of the Fusion Radiomics score. Together with two clinical factors (tumor embolus and ALBI grade), a radiomics nomogram was developed with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.894 (95\% CI, 0.797–0.991) and 0.883 (95\% CI, 0.716–0.998) in the training and validation cohort, respectively. The calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed that nomogram had good consistency and clinical usefulness. Conclusions This study has developed and validated a radiomics nomogram by incorporating the pretreatment CECT images and clinical factors to predict the anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy in patients with advanced HCC.},

Studies using nonimaging features or incorporating non-DL methods for feature extraction or classification were excluded. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusion, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Internal and external performance measures and pertinent study characteristics were extracted, and relationships among these data were examined using nonparametric statistics. Results Eighty-three studies reporting 86 algorithms were included. The vast majority (70 of 86, 81\%) reported at least some decrease in external performance compared with internal performance, with nearly half (42 of 86, 49\%) reporting at least a modest decrease (≥0.05 on the unit scale) and nearly a quarter (21 of 86, 24\%) reporting a substantial decrease (≥0.10 on the unit scale). No study characteristics were found to be associated with the difference between internal and external performance.

After reviewing previous work on this issue, we introduce a novel application of maximum entropy to quantify the spatial distribution of discrete point-like objects. We apply our approach to B and T cells in images of tumor tissue taken from triple negative breast cancer patients. We find that the immune cells are more spatially dispersed in good clinical outcome (no recurrence of cancer within at least 5 years of diagnosis) compared to poor clinical outcome (recurrence within 3 years of diagnosis). Our results highlight the importance of spatial distribution of immune cells within tumors with regard to clinical outcome, and raise new questions on their role in cancer recurrence.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Predicting the survival rate for patients with cancer is currently performed using the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM). Identifying  accurate prognostic markers of survival would allow better treatment stratification  between more aggressive treatment strategies or palliation. This is especially  relevant for patients with spinal metastases, who all have identical TNM staging and  whose surgical decision-making is potentially complex. Analytical morphometrics  quantifies patient frailty by measuring lean muscle mass and can predict risk for  postoperative morbidity after lumbar spine surgery. This study evaluates whether  morphometrics can be predictive of survival in patients with spinal metastases.  METHODS Utilizing a retrospective registry of patients with spinal metastases who  had undergone stereotactic body radiation therapy, the authors identified patients  with primary lung cancer. Morphometric measurements were taken of the psoas muscle  using CT of the lumbar spine. Additional morphometrics were taken of the L-4  vertebral body. Patients were stratified into tertiles based on psoas muscle area.  The primary outcome measure was overall survival, which was measured from the date  of the patient's CT scan to date of death. RESULTS A total of 168 patients were  identified, with 54\% male and 54\% having multiple-level metastases. The median  survival for all patients was 185.5 days (95\% confidence interval [CI] 146-228  days). Survival was not associated with age, sex, or the number of levels of  metastasis. Patients in the smallest tertile for the left psoas area had  significantly shorter survival compared with a combination of the other two  tertiles: 139 days versus 222 days, respectively, hazard ratio (HR) 1.47, 95\% CI  1.06-2.04, p = 0.007. Total psoas tertiles were not predictive of mortality, but  patients whose total psoas size was below the median size had significantly shorter  survival compared with those greater than the median size: 146 days versus 253.5  days, respectively, HR 1.43, 95\% CI 1.05-1.94, p = 0.025. To try to differentiate  small body habitus from frailty, the ratio of psoas muscle area to vertebral body  area was calculated. Total psoas size became predictive of mortality when normalized  to vertebral body ratio, with patients in the lowest tertile having significantly  shorter survival (p = 0.017). Left psoas to vertebral body ratio was also predictive  of mortality in patients within the lowest tertile (p = 0.021). Right psoas size was  not predictive of mortality in any calculations. CONCLUSIONS In patients with lung  cancer metastases to the spine, morphometric analysis of psoas muscle and vertebral  body size can be used to identify patients who are at risk for shorter survival.  This information should be used to select patients who are appropriate candidates  for surgery and for the tailoring of oncological treatment regimens.},

New objective methods of  predicting overall survival would be beneficial for surgical decision making.  Morphometrics quantifies patient frailty and has been successfully used to predict  overall survival in patients with lung cancer spinal metastases. This study  evaluated whether morphometrics can predict survival in patients with prostate  cancer spinal metastases. METHODS: Using a retrospective registry of patients with  spinal metastases who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy, we identified  patients with primary prostate cancer. Morphometric measurements of the psoas muscle  were taken from most recent lumbar spine computed tomography. Patients were  stratified into lowest, middle, and highest tertiles based on psoas muscle area.  Primary outcome measure was overall survival from the date of computed tomography  scan. RESULTS: We identified 92 patients. Median survival for all patients was 124  days (95\% confidence interval, 98-197 days). Patients in the smallest third for  average psoas size had significantly shorter survival compared with patients in the  largest third: 117 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.42; 95\% confidence interval,  1.32-4.43; P~= 0.004). Patients in the middle third for average psoas size also had  shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 113 days versus 302  days (hazard ratio 2.31; 95\% confidence interval, 1.25-4.25; P~= 0.007).  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases, morphometric  analysis of psoas muscle size can identify patients at risk for shorter survival.  This technique can aid in surgical decision making by weighing expected survival and  fitness versus potential morbidity of intervention.},

PURPOSE: Our study evaluates whether morphometrics is predictive of survival in  patients with breast cancer spinal metastasis. DESIGN: This is an observational  retrospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: This study includes female patients with  breast cancer spinal metastases and patients who have undergone stereotactic body  radiation therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival was the primary outcome  measure. METHODS: Morphometric measurements of the psoas muscle were taken using  computed tomography scans of the lumbar spine. We then stratified patients into  tertiles based on the psoas muscle area. RESULTS: We identified 118 patients, with a  median survival of 104 days (95\% confidence interval [CI]=73-157 days). Overall  survival was not associated with age, chemotherapy, or number of levels radiated.  Patients in the lowest tertile of psoas size had significantly shorter survival  compared with the highest tertile (68 days versus 148 days, hazard ratio 1.76 [95\%  CI=1.08-2.89], p=.024). The shorter survival was also true for the lowest tertile  versus the middle tertile (68 days versus 167 days, hazard ratio 1.95 [95\%  CI=1.19-3.19], p=.007). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to visually  illustrate the differences in survival between different tertiles. CONCLUSIONS:  Morphometric analysis of the psoas muscle size in patients with breast cancer  metastases to the spine was effective in identifying patients at risk of shorter  survival. Further research is needed to validate these results, as well as to see if  these methodologies can be applied to other cancer histologies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting survival of patients with spinal metastases would help stratify treatments from aggressive to palliation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether  sarcopenia predicts survival in patients with lung, breast, prostate, or multiple  myeloma spinal metastases. METHODS: Psoas muscle measurements in patients with  spinal metastasis were taken from computed tomography scans at 2 time points: at  first episode of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and from the most recent  scan available. Overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated with multivariate  cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS: In 417 patients with spinal  metastases, 40\% had lung cancer, 27\% breast, 21\% prostate, and 11\% myeloma. Overall  survival was not associated with age, sex, ethnicity, levels treated, or SBRT  volume. Multivariate analysis showed patients in the lowest psoas tertile had  shorter survival (222 d, 95\% CI~=~185-323 d) as compared to the largest tertile (579  d, 95\% CI~=~405-815 d), (HR1.54, P~=~.005). Median psoas size as a cutoff value was  also strongly predictive for survival (HR1.48, P~=~.002). Survival was independent  of tumor histology. The psoas/vertebral body ratio was also successful in predicting  overall survival independent of tumor histology and gender (HR1.52, P~{$<~$}.01).  Kaplan-Meier survival curves visually represent survival (P~=~.0005). CONCLUSION: In  patients with spine metastases, psoas muscle size as a hallmark of  frailty/sarcopenia is an objective, simple, and effective way to identify patients  who are at risk for shorter survival, regardless of tumor histology. This  information can be used to help with surgical decision making in patients with  advanced cancer, as patients with small psoas sizes are at higher risk of death.},

The importance of the pylorus in the proper functioning of the digestive tract is widely accepted. Although it is commonly known that sensory innervation plays an important role in the regulation of gastric activity and gastrointestinal tissue resistance, there is complete lack of data on the extrinsic afferents projecting to the swine pylorus. The present experiment has been designed to discover the precise localization and neurochemical properties of the primary sensory neurons projecting to the porcine pylorus. Combined retrograde tracing technique and double immunocytochemistry were applied in five piglets. An additional RT-PCR reaction was used to confirm the presence of all investigated neurotransmitters in the studied ganglia. Traced neurons were localized within the bilateral nodose ganglia of the vagus and bilateral dorsal root ganglia spreading from Th4 to L1. Fast Blue-positive afferents expressed immunoreactivity to substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase, and galanin. In the vagal and spinal ganglia, the percentages of traced neurons immunoreactive to these substances were 54.8, 10.7, 49.6, 7.4~\% and 22.2, 75.5, 95.2~\%, respectively, and the solitary perikarya were Gal immunoreactive. The presence of all substances studied in the ganglion tissue was confirmed by RT-PCR technique.},

Before these tools are used for computer-aided diagnosis in real-world clinical settings, we must verify their ability to generalize across a variety of hospital systems. A cross-sectional design was used to train and evaluate pneumonia screening CNNs on 158,323 chest x-rays from NIH (n=112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai (42,396 from 12,904 patients), and Indiana (n=3,807 from 3,683 patients). In 3 / 5 natural comparisons, performance on chest x-rays from outside hospitals was significantly lower than on held-out x-rays from the original hospital systems. CNNs were able to detect where an x-ray was acquired (hospital system, hospital department) with extremely high accuracy and calibrate predictions accordingly. The performance of CNNs in diagnosing diseases on x-rays may reflect not only their ability to identify disease-specific imaging findings on x-rays, but also their ability to exploit confounding information. Estimates of CNN performance based on test data from hospital systems used for model training may overstate their likely real-world performance.}

  abstract = {Clinical evaluation poorly predicts outcomes in lung cancer treated with immunotherapy. The aim of the study is to assess whether CT-derived texture parameters can predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with first line Pembrolizumab. Twenty-one patients with NSLC were prospectively enrolled; they underwent contrast enhanced CT (CECT) at baseline and during Pembrolizumab treatment. Response to therapy was assessed both with clinical and iRECIST criteria. Two radiologists drew a volume of interest of the tumor at baseline CECT, extracting several texture parameters. ROC curves, a univariate Kaplan-Meyer analysis and Cox proportional analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of texture analysis. Twelve (57\%) patients showed partial response to therapy while nine (43\%) had confirmed progressive disease. Among texture parameters, mean value of positive pixels (MPP) at fine and medium filters showed an AUC of 72\% and 74\% respectively (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Kaplan-Meyer analysis showed that MPP\,{$<$}\,56.2 were significantly associated with lower OS and PFS (P\,{$<$}\,0.0035). Cox proportional analysis showed a significant correlation between MPP4 and OS (P\,=\,0.0038; HR\,=\,0.89[CI 95\%:0.83,0.96]). In conclusion, MPP could be used as predictive imaging biomarkers of OS and PFS in patients with NSLC with first line immune treatment.},

  abstract = {A common goal of epidemiologic research is to study the association between a certain exposure and a certain outcome, while controlling for important covariates. This is often done by fitting a restricted mean model for the outcome, as in generalized linear models (GLMs) and in generalized estimating equations (GEEs). If the covariates are high-dimensional, then it may be difficult to well specify the model. This is an important concern, since model misspecification may lead to biased estimates. Doubly robust estimation is an estimation technique that offers some protection against model misspecification. It utilizes two models, one for the outcome and one for the exposure, and produces unbiased estimates of the exposure-outcome association if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Despite its obvious appeal, doubly robust estimation is not used on a regular basis in applied epidemiologic research. One reason for this could be the lack of up-to-date software. In this paper we describe a new R package, drgee , which carries out doubly robust estimation in restricted mean models. The package is constructed to be user-friendly and fast, to facilitate routine use of doubly robust estimation. The paper is structured into theory sections and example sections. The former are intended to serve as a brief but self-consistent tutorial in doubly robust estimation. The latter illustrate the use of the drgee package through practical examples. We have used publically available data throughout the paper, so that the reader can easily replicate all examples.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose Risk prediction of overall survival (OS) is crucial for gastric cancer (GC) patients to assess the treatment programs and may guide personalized medicine. A novel deep learning (DL) model was proposed to predict the risk for OS based on computed tomography (CT) images. Materials and methods We retrospectively collected 640 patients from three independent centers, which were divided into a training cohort (center 1 and center 2, n~=~518) and an external validation cohort (center 3, n~=~122). We developed a DL model based on the architecture of residual convolutional neural network. We augmented the size of training dataset by image transformations to avoid overfitting. We also developed radiomics and clinical models for comparison. The performance of the three models were comprehensively assessed. Results Totally 518 patients were prepared by data augmentation and fed into DL model. The trained DL model significantly classified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in training cohort (P-value {$<$}0.001, concordance index (C-index): 0.82, hazard ratio (HR): 9.79) and external validation cohort (P-value {$<$}0.001, C-index: 0.78, HR: 11.76). Radiomics model was developed with selected 24 features and clinical model was developed with three significant clinical variables (P-value {$<$}0.05). The comparison illustrated DL model had the best performance for risk prediction of OS according to the C-index (training: DL vs Clinical vs Radiomics~=~0.82 vs 0.73 vs 0.66; external validation: 0.78 vs 0.71 vs 0.72). Conclusion The DL model is a powerful model for risk assessment, and potentially serves as an individualized recommender for decision-making in GC patients.},

  abstract = {The treatment effects of medications play a key role in guiding medical prescriptions. They are usually assessed with randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are expensive. Recently, large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) have become available, opening up new opportunities for more cost-effective assessments. However, assessing a treatment effect from EHRs is challenging: it is biased by unobserved confounders, unmeasured variables that affect both patients' medical prescription and their outcome, e.g. the patients' social economic status. To adjust for unobserved confounders, we develop the medical deconfounder, a machine learning algorithm that unbiasedly estimates treatment effects from EHRs. The medical deconfounder first constructs a substitute confounder by modeling which medications were prescribed to each patient; this substitute confounder is guaranteed to capture all multi-medication confounders, observed or unobserved (arXiv:1805.06826). It then uses this substitute confounder to adjust for the confounding bias in the analysis. We validate the medical deconfounder on two simulated and two real medical data sets. Compared to classical approaches, the medical deconfounder produces closer-to-truth treatment effect estimates; it also identifies effective medications that are more consistent with the findings in the medical literature.}

Unfortunately, this assumption is frequently violated in real-world applications, since some variables only affect the treatment but not the outcome, and vice versa. Moreover, in many cases only the proxy variables of the underlying confounding factors can be observed. In this work, we first show the importance of differentiating confounding factors from instrumental and risk factors for both average and conditional average treatment effect estimation, and then we propose a variational inference approach to simultaneously infer latent factors from the observed variables, disentangle the factors into three disjoint sets corresponding to the instrumental, confounding, and risk factors, and use the disentangled factors for treatment effect estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a wide range of synthetic, benchmark, and real-world datasets.},

This loss does not require the translated image to be translated back to be a specific source image but can encourage the translated images to retain important features of the source images and overcome the drawbacks of cycle-consistency loss noted above.

  abstract = {Despite ethical and historical arguments for removing race from clinical algorithms, the consequences of removal remain unclear. Here, we highlight a largely undiscussed consideration in this debate: varying data quality of input features across race groups. For example, family history of cancer is an essential predictor in cancer risk prediction algorithms but is less reliably documented for Black participants and may therefore be less predictive of cancer outcomes. Using data from the Southern Community Cohort Study, we assessed whether race adjustments could allow risk prediction models to capture varying data quality by race, focusing on colorectal cancer risk prediction. We analyzed 77,836 adults with no history of colorectal cancer at baseline. The predictive value of self-reported family history was greater for White participants than for Black participants. We compared two cancer risk prediction algorithms—a race-blind algorithm which included standard colorectal cancer risk factors but not race, and a race-adjusted algorithm which additionally included race. Relative to the race-blind algorithm, the race-adjusted algorithm improved predictive performance, as measured by goodness of fit in a likelihood ratio test (P-value: {$<$}0.001) and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve among Black participants (P-value: 0.006). Because the race-blind algorithm underpredicted risk for Black participants, the race-adjusted algorithm increased the fraction of Black participants among the predicted high-risk group, potentially increasing access to screening. More broadly, this study shows that race adjustments may be beneficial when the data quality of key predictors in clinical algorithms differs by race group.}

  abstract = {The need for continuing provision of beneficial experimental interventions after research is concluded remains a controversial topic in bioethics for research. Based on the principle of beneficence, justice as reciprocity, concerns about exploitation and fair benefits, participants should be able to have continuing access to benefits beyond the research period. However, there is no consensus about whether or not post-trial provision of beneficial interventions should be mandatory for participants from developing countries. This paper summarises recommendations from international and national guidelines. Ethical principles and practical issues relating to post-trial provision are also discussed. In conclusion, post-trial provision is not necessary in all situations and a set of criteria are proposed to identify the situations that beneficial interventions should be provided beyond the research period. However, mandatory post-trial supply of beneficial experimental interventions should be assured for those who still need and are able to benefit from them but have no alternative access. Mandatory provision is based on universal bioethical principles such as beneficence and justice. Furthermore, difficulties associated with implementation of post-trial provision are not unmanageable. Careful advanced planning and a comprehensive partnership among relevant parties would be very helpful in solving these difficulties in practice, which therefore should not be taken as an excuse to escape post-trial responsibility.}
