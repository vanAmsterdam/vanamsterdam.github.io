## Intro

This comes up frequently in medical literature: selecting variables for a multivariable analysis, based on univariate significance, AKA 'forward selection'.
For many reasons, this is a bad idea.
I will repeat one of these reasons here: the effect of your super-duper new predictor may be **negatively** confoundend by another variable.
Not including this confounding variable in the analysis will lead to wrongfully reject your new predictor.
A paper on this problem can be found here https://doi.org/10.1016/0895-4356(96)00025-X

## Example

Let's consider the following example.
Researchers are want to 


```{r}
set.seed(20191220)
nsim        <- 1000
sex         <- rbinom(p=.5, n=nsim, size=1)
activity    <- rbinom(p=.3+.3*sex, n=nsim, size=1)
muscle_mass <- rbinom(p=.2+.3*sex+.2*activity, n=nsim, size=1)
cad         <- rbinom(p=.1+.2*sex-.1*activity-.1*muscle_mass, n=nsim, size=1)

```
