# Assigning causality for treatment-intent modelling

Statistics and machine learning inform us to expect when passively observing the world, but as health care professionals and researchers we typically aim to improve health care. Improving health care, either at the individual patient level or at a system level, requires knowing the effects of interventions or treatments, preferably tailored to the unique patient or situation. The best way to learn the effects of treatments is with randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but RCTs are expensive, slow, and sometimes unethical. Causal Inference formally defines what a treatment effect is and how it may be estimated inside and outside of RCTs. Causal inference thereby broadens the range of causal questions we can realistically answer and datasets we can use to do so.

In this talk, I introduce a ‘language’ of causal inference, using the Potential Outcome framework. Next, I discuss how directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) help designing causal inference studies. I’ll provide a template of a typical causal inference study and will finish with challenges and opportunities of causal inference typical to the field of oncology.
