## Why causal inference {background-image="estrobg.png" background-size="contain"}

### We want to know what to do

- statistical learning from passively collected data:
  - observe: patients with metastases [poor survival]{.fragment style="color:red;"}
- from these data we can learn what to expect when we passively observe the world
  - observe: stage I lung cancer patients
      - with surgery: [good survival]{style="color:green"}
      - with radiotherapy: [poor survival]{style="color:red"}

### We want to know what to do

if we now stop using radiotherapy and only operate, regardless of age, comorbidities, fitness, will patients live longer?

## Why causal inference

### health care professionals are typically concerned with improving the world, meaning making changes (interventions) that improve outcomes

- the best way to learn about what treatments (or *interventions*) are most effective is by performing them in a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
- in causal inference we destinguish these experimental data from RCTs from observational data (=passively collected)
- though RCTs are ideal from a theoretical point of view, they are challenged by logistical, financial and ethical issues
- RCT for every possible change (e.g. dose adjustment, radiotherapy fractioning) infeasible, but we have observational data

## What is causal inference?

[- (as a verb) [statistical inference]{style="color: red"} about a [causal question]{style="color: red"}]{.fragment fragment-index=1}

[- (as a field) define causal quantities and deduce how to them from available data given assumptions]{.fragment fragment-index=2}

[- (in practice abstractly) perform an experiment (trial) or [emulate]{.alert} performing an experiment from non-experimental (observational) data]{.fragment fragment-index=4}

[- (in practice concretely)]{.fragment fragment-index=5}

## Causal inference frameworks, a high-level introduction

### Potential outcome framework

- for individual: define *potential outcome* as outcome that would be observed when giving a certain treatment
- define *individual treatment effect* (ITE) as difference in potential outcomes under treatments
- *fundamental problem*: only one potential outcome observed (the other is *counterfactual*)
- average of ITEs is the *average treatment effect* (ATE): can be estimated in RCTs, providing evidence for treatment guidelines

## Causal inference frameworks, a high-level introduction

### Directed acyclic graphs / structural causal models

[- formalize model of world with variables (treatment, determinants of treatment, outcome) and *causal relationships* between these variables]{.fragment}

[- define treatment effect as perfect intervention on a variable (i.e. force treatment = surgery) and calculate outcomes ($\Pr(Y=1|\text{do}(T=1))$)]{.fragment}

[- can be estimated from data when the right assumptions are met for data available]{.fragment}

## Causal inference frameworks

### Differences and agreements

- frameworks address the question of [identification]{style="color:orange;"}: can a causal question be estimated from observed data?
- when given same data and assumptions, inferences are the same
- main concerns in both settings: identify confounders, assume positivity
- inferences rely on unverifyable assumptions
- PO: definitions less abstract
- DAGs: specifying assumptions less abstract

## DAGs: other uses

- read off variable 'types'
  - confounders (ancestors of treatment and outcome)
  - colliders (common effects)
  - mediators
- other uses:
  - missing data mechanisms 
  - selection diagrams
  - transportability

## Setting up a causal inference study

1. define question and target trial
2. gather data
3. formalize assumptions
4. decide how to estimate
5. sensitivity analyses
6. statistical inference
7. interpret

# opportunities and challenges of causal inference with observational data in oncology

## challenge: unobserved confounding by overall fitness

![](proxydag.png)

need other methods of identification

- proxy methods
- instrumental variable methods
- front door adjustment

## opportunities:

- new biomarkers: need estimate of treatment effect before running a trial
- generalization of RCT estimates to general population
- risk based treatment decisions: e.g. decide on adjuvant therapy based on risk of recurrence under no adjuvant therapy (this risk has / needs a *causal* interpretation, i.e. *risk the intervention of not given adjuvant therapy as would be observed in the control arm of an RCT*)
- prediction-under-intervention: expected outcome under hypothetical treatment options
