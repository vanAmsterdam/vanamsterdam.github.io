## Why causal inference

- With statistical learning we can learn what to expect when we passively observe the world
- health care professionals are typically concerned with improving the world, meaning making changes (interventions) that improve outcomes
- the best way to learn about what interventions (or treatments) are most effective is by performing them in a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
- though RCTs are ideal from a theoretical point of view, they are challenged by logistical, financial and ethical issues

## Potential outcome framework: from ITE to ATE

## DAGs: identifying confounders, colliders and mediators

- other uses:
  - missing data mechanisms 
  - selection diagrams
  - transportability

## Setting up a causal inference study

1. define question and target trial
    - treatment intent or per-protocol analysis?
2. gather data
3. formalize assumptions
4. causal inference method
5. sensitivity analyses
6. statistical inference
7. interpret

## opportunities and challenges in oncology

## challenges: unobserved confounding by overall fitness

proxy methods, IV methods, front door

## opportunities:

- new biomarkers
- generalization to population
- risk based treatment decisions

## other applications

prediction under intervention

## resources

- book of why
- what if
