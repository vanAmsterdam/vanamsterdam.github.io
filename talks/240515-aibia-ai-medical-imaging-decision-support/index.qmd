## Uses of AI in medical imaging

1. Acquisition 'from RAW to $X$'

   :::{.fragment .current-visible}
   ::::{.nonincremental}
   - k-space to MRI image
   - raw projection data to CT image
   - denoising
   ::::
   :::

2. detection / segmentation on $X$ (i.e. deterministic functions)
   
   :::{.fragment .current-visible}
   ::::{.nonincremental}
   - segmenting organs at risk in radiotherapy
   ::::
   :::

3. inference / diagnosis

   :::{.fragment .current-visible}
   ::::{.nonincremental}
   - medical diagnosis
   ::::
   :::

4. prognosis

   :::{.fragment .current-visible}
   ::::{.nonincremental}
   - expected survival time given CT-scan
   ::::
   :::

5. treatment effect

   :::{.fragment .current-visible}
   ::::{.nonincremental}
   - effect of immunotherapy given T-cell distribution around tumor
   ::::
   :::

## Decision support uses

- Uses 4 and 5 (prognosis and treatment effect) have an element of future time
- 4 is also typically aimed at decision support


## How to estimate treatment effects based on images

1. Perform a randomized controlled trial
2. Collect (imaging) data at randomization
3. Use e.g. [TARnet](@shalitEstimatingIndividualTreatment2017) to estimate outcomes conditional on image and treatment
4. treatment effect $= f(X,T=1) - f(X,T=0)$

## What if you cannot do a (big enough) RCT?

Emulate / approximate the ideal trial in observational data you do have, using **causal inference** techniques **(which rely on untestable assumptions)**

## The in-between: predicting prognosis but using it for decision support

"Prognosis cannot be divorced from contemplated medical action, nor from action to be taken by the patient in response to prognostication.‚Äù
