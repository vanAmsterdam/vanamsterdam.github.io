	abstract = {There is intense interest in applying machine learning to problems of causal inference in fields such as healthcare, economics and education. In particular, individual-level causal inference has important applications such as precision medicine. We give a new theoretical analysis and family of algorithms for predicting individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data, under the assumption known as strong ignorability. The algorithms learn a "balanced" representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look similar. We give a novel, simple and intuitive generalization-error bound showing that the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances. Experiments on real and simulated data show the new algorithms match or outperform the state-of-the-art.},

    abstract = {The medical concept of prognosis is analysed into its basic constituents: patient data, medical intervention, outcome, utilities and probabilities; and sources of utility and probability values are discussed. Prognosis cannot be divorced from contemplated medical action, nor from action to be taken by the patient in response to prognostication. Regrettably, the usual decision-theoretic approach ignores this latter aspect. Elicitation of utilities, decision contemplation and prognostic counselling interweave, diagnostics playing a subsidiary role in decision-oriented clinical practice. At times the doctor has grounds for withholding information. As this is known to the patient, prognostic counselling becomes a conflict-prone and rationality-thwarting activity. The meaning of standard phrases such as “prognosis of a disease”, “the prognosis of this patient”, “the prognosis is unknown”, is examined.},

“Prognosis cannot be divorced from contemplated medical action, nor from action to be taken by the patient in response to prognostication.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 349)“the prognosis of a certain disease is the typical course of illness in response to such and such treatment, together with the spectrum of random deviations from that course. Or better: whatever is understood by the prognosis of an individual patient, the prognosis of the disease is the distribution of the individual prognoses of its 'victims'.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 350)“formally, a family of outcome distributions conditional on case data and on treatment.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 350)“we must establish empirical prognoses by examining the treatment response of recognisable case classes, which need not be diseases.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 351)“imagine a huge controlled trial comparing all possible case management policies in a sample of cases which, in all known respects, look identical to the patient being prognosticated.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 351)“A prognostication contains a prediction conditioned on the patient's characteristics -- as they are known when it is written down -- and on medical action. For example, "on anticoagulant treatment this type of patient will have a 5\% risk of suffering a stroke within the next 24 months". A complete prognostication would be one which contained a prediction for any conceivable medical action.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 352) this is prediction under intervention“A complete prognostication in the defined sense is a bundle of actionconditional outcome predictions (action-specific prognoses), from which the clinician must pick out the most promising one.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 353)“(3A) The standard prognosis of a given patient may be defined as the average chosen prognosis, it being understood that doctors do not always choose the same treatment and sometimes even make outright mistakes.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 353) prognosis under average treatment policy“There is no objectivity, only breaches of objectivity. There is no rationality other than efforts to eliminate sloppy and illogical modes of thought.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 354) causal inference frameworks improve this“For each outcome the doctor assesses its probability conditional on patient characteristics and action (action-specific prognosis). This is done for every action (complete prognostication). The utility for this particular patient of each outcome is assessed. Utilities are combined with action-specific prognoses so as to obtain action-specific expected utilites. The action of greatest expected utility is chosen and the associated action-specific prognosis (the 'chosen prognosis') is communicated to the patient and his relatives.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 355) expected utility“Likewise, the doctor's words may not only prepare him for suffering but may also mean a burden of anticipated suffering. They may not only help him make decisions but may also leave him with a continual worry about having chosen the wrong option.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 357)“The amount of such fear -- but also the amount of hope -- depends strongly, we think, on the alternative outcomes mentioned during prognostic counselling, or, in somewhat technocratic terms, on the variance of the outcome utility as expressed by the doctor when explaining the chosen prognosis. Thus, professed uncertainty is in itself generally undesirable.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 358) oneherheid gaveheftmodeler“The points listed here suffice to show there are sometimes rational or semi-rational grounds for the doctor to withhold some information or understate the uncertainty.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 359)“predictions conditional on the chosen action (chosen prognoses) in patient counselling” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 359)“Some diagnostic tests can be carried out by robots, and there is no reason why a deft therapist (surgeon, say) should also be a competent decisionist. Prognostic counselling and elicitation of utilities, on the other hand, cannot be divorced from the cognitive tasks. We are left with the six non-bracketed activities, which in our opinion form the true core of clinical work.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 360) surgeon is a therapist not a clinician“the position of diagnostics is stronger, so strong, in fact, that many writers feel obliged to warn against carrying it too far, that is, beyond what is warranted from a therapeutic-prognostic point of view. Its position is stronger precisely for lack of all the statistical data needed for the pure, empirical approach that we have outlined: we must fill the gaps by mechanistic reasoning in terms of specific malfunctions, causal connections and etiologic agents, etc.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 361) diagnosis is causal reasoning, used when prognosis and statistics are unavailable“A good prognostician is one who can make realistic action-specific prognoses and accurate patient-guided utility assessments and, hence, suggest a near-optimal action and state the chosen prognosis with a high degree of objective validity.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 361)“As a counsel to his patient, he must know how and when to discuss the future in a compassionate manner, without arousing fear or suspicion.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 361) doctor must counsel without arousing fear“One main difficulty is clearly that it will never be known how accurate a prognostician's prediction was for those treatments the patient did not receive.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 362) fundamental problem of causal inference“The good prognostician strikes the right balance when judging which experience is relevant to a given case and how to extrapolate therefrom (Section 2.1.2). It is a matter of "skilful conditioning", as one of our commentators put it. Unfortunately, this is an aspect of clinical behaviour which seems overwhelmingly difficult to evaluate in practice. It belongs to the art as opposed to the science of medicine, one may say with Blois,12 keeping in mind, of course, that speaking of art vs. science is here just picture language -- a vague but suggestive distinction.” (Hilden and Habbema, 1987, p. 362)
