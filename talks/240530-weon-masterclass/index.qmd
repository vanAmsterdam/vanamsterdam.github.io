Whereas treatment effect estimation is typically thought of as a *causal* task requiring *causal* approaches (e.g. randomized controllerd trials), prognosis models are often advertised for making treatment decisions.

## Using prediction models for decision making is often thought of as a good idea

For example:

1. give chemotherapy to cancer patients with high predicted risk of recurrence
2. give statins to patients with a high risk of a heart attack

## This may lead to bad situations when:

1. ignoring the treatments patients may have had during training / validation of (AI) prediction model
2. only considering measures of predictive accuracy as sufficient evidence for safe deployment

## Treatment-naive prediction models

Results from [@vanamsterdamWhenAccuratePrediction2024a]

1. good or bad discrimination post deployment may be a sign of a harmful or a beneficial policy change
2. models that are perfectly calibrated before and after deployment are certainly not useful for decision making because they didn't change the distribution

[Is this obvious?]{.r-fit-text}

<!--::: {.callout-tip}-->

<!--It may seem obvious that you should not ignore historical treatments in your prediction models, if you want to improve treatment decisions, but many of these models are published daily, and some guidelines even allow for implementing these models based on predictve performance only-->

## Prediction modeling is very popular in medical research

## Recommended validation practices and reporting guidelines do not protect against harm

### because they do not evaluate the policy change

What to do?
:::

1.  Evaluate policy change (cluster randomized controlled trial)
2.  Build models that are likely to have value for decision making

# Building and validating models for decision support

## Deploying a model is an intervention that changes the way treatment decisions are made

![](figs/policy_changebx.png){fig-align="center"}

## How do we learn about the effect of an intervention?

With a randomized experiment

<!--With causal inference!-->

- for using a decision support model, the unit of intervention is usually *the doctor*
- randomly assign *doctors* to have access to the model or not
- measure differences in **treatment decisions** and **patient outcomes**
- this called a cluster RCT
- if using model improves outcomes, use that one

. . . 

:::{.callout-tip icon="false"}

## Using cluster RCTs to evaluated models for decision making is not a new idea [@cooperEvaluationMachinelearningMethods1997]

“As one possibility, suppose that a trial is performed in which clinicians are randomized either to have or not to have access to such a decision aid in making decisions about where to treat patients who present with pneumonia.” 

:::

. . .

:::{.callout-warning}
## What we don't learn
was the model predicting anything sensible?
:::

## So build treatment-naive prediction models and trial them for decision support?

Not a good idea

- baking a cake without a recipe
- hoping it turns into something nice
- not pleasant to people that need to taste result of the experiment
  - (i.e. patients may have side-effects / die)

## We should build models that are likely to be valuable for decision making

- Build models that predict expected outcomes under *hypothetical interventions* (*prediction-under-intervention models*)
- doctor / patient can pick the treatment with *best* expected outcomes, depending on patient's values
- whereas *treatment-naive* prediction models average out over the historic treatment policy, prediction-under-intervention allows the user to select a treatment option

. . .

## Hilden and Habbema on prognosis [@hildenPrognosisMedicineAnalysis1987]
"Prognosis cannot be divorced from contemplated medical action, nor from action to be taken by the patient in response to prognostication.” 
:::

- prediction-under-intervention is not a new idea, but language and methods on causality have come a long way since [@hildenPrognosisMedicineAnalysis1987].

## Estimand for prediction-under-intervention models

What is the estimand?

- prediction: $E[Y|X]$
- treatment effect: $E[Y|\text{do}(T=1)] - E[Y|\text{do}(T=0)]$
- prediction-under-intervention: $E[Y|\text{do}(T=t),X]$

## More on prediction-under-intervention models

development:

- ideally estimated from RCTs, but these are often too small or don't measure the right data
- alternatively can use observational data and causal inference methods
    - this approach relies on **strong assumptions** especially regarding confounding
- but likely a better recipe than *treatment-naive* models

. . .

evaluation:

- prediction accuracy can be tested in RCTs, or in observational data with specialized methods accounting for confounding [e.g. @keoghPredictionInterventionsEvaluation2024]
- a new *policy* can be evaluated in historic RCTs [e.g. @karmaliBloodPressureloweringTreatment2018]
- ultimate test is cluster RCT

## Take-aways

- when developing or evaluating (AI) prediction models for medical decisions, think about
  - what is the effect of using this model on medical decisions?
  - what is the effect of this policy change on patient outcomes?
- deploying models for decision support is an intervention and should be evaluated as such
- prediction-under-intervention models have a foreseeable effect on patient oucomes when used for decision making
