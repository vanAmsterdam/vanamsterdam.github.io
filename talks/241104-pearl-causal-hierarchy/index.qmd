# The ladder of questions

## The ladder is a hierarchy of questions

![table 1](figs/bareinboim-table1.png)

## Notation

- $X$: treatment (binary, 0,1)
- $Y$: outcome (binary)
- $Z$: covariate (age, sex)
- $p(Y|Z)$: conditional distribution of $Y$ given $Z$ (e.g. regression, 'prediction')
- $p(Y_x)$: the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$, e.g.:
  - $p(Y_{X=1}=1)$: the probability that $Y$ would take value 1 when we would set $X$ to 1 *by intervention*
  - $P(Y_1) - P(Y_0) = \text{ATE}$ (average treatment effect)

## Layer 1: association

- What is the relationship between two or more variables?
- required:
  - data (observational / non-experimental): $p(X,Y,Z)$
- questions:
  - what is the expected survival for men, and for women? $p(Y|Z=1)$, $p(Y|Z=0)$

## Layer 2: intervention

- What happens if we intervene on a variable?
- by how much would survival change if we would treat every patient with a certain drug?
  - this can be made subgroup specific (the *conditional* average treatment effect: CATE), e.g. covariate $Z$: $p(Y_{X=1}|Z) - p(Y_{X=0}|Z)$
  - when covariate $Z$ is continuous, every patient has a different CATE, but conceptually this is still the CATE (average over population with same / similar value of $Z$), not *individual* treatment effect
- $p(Y_{X=1}=1|Z=z)$: the conditional probability that $Y$ would take value 1 when we would set $X$ to 1 *by intervention*, given that $Z=z$
    - aka 'prediction under (hypothertical) intervention'
    - aka 'potential outcome prediction'
    - aka 'counterfactual prediction'

## Layer 2: intervention, what is required?

1. data where $X$ is controlled by experimentation (randomized controlled trial)
2. observational data + sufficient assumptions, typically:
  - the directed acyclic graph (DAG) for the variables and no unobserved confounders

. . . 

![DAG 1](tikzs/dag1.png)

## Layer 3: counterfactuals

- What would have happened if we had done something else?
- questions:
  - given that the ICU patient got vancomycin and developed acute kidney injury, would she have developed AKI if she had not received vancomycin?
  - $P(Y_{X=0}=1|Y=1,X=1)$
- counterfactuals have an element of:
  - something occured in the world (a *fact*)
  - what if we went back to the world and changed a thing, what would have occured then? (a *counterfact*)
- required:
  - knowledge of *functional relationships*

## The hierarchy, what are the worlds?

## Layer 2: directed acyclic graph (DAG)


1. association: the world as it is
2. intervention: the world as we could be under an intervention (as it would be / is in an experiment)
3. counterfactuals: the world as it was, **and** how it might have been if something had been different

## The hierarchy, what are the worlds?

1. one real world
2. one hypothetical world (or real in experiment)
3. one real world **and** a hypothetical world

## What are the layers useful for?

1. association: description, prediction (know what to expect when observing the world with hands on our backs)
2. intervention: policy making, decision making (know what to expect when we change the world)
3. counterfactuals: explanation, understanding:
  - drug side effects
  - *digital twins*: a digital representation of a physical object or system: typically assumes counterfactual level knowledge, e.g. @selBuildingDigitalTwins2024
  - questions of fairness

# The building blocks: structural causal models

## What is a SCM?

![definition of SCM](figs/bareinboim-definition1.png)

- $U$ is a set of background variables, also called exogenous variables, that are determined by factors outside the model;
- $V$ is a set $\{V_1,V_2,...,V_n\}$ of variables, called endogenous, that are determined by other variables in the model - that is, variables in $U\cup V$;
- $F$ is a set of functions $\{ f_1, f_2,..., f_n\}$ such that each fiis a mapping from (the respective domains of) $U_i \cup Pa_i \to V_i$, where $U_i \subset U$, $Pa_i \subset V - Vi$, and the entire set $F$ forms a mapping from $U$ to $V$. That is, for $i = 1,...,n$, each $f_i \in F$ is such that

. . .

$$v_i \leftarrow f_i(pa_i, u_i)$$

- i.e., it assigns a value to $V_i$ that depends on (the values of) a select set of variables in $U \cup V$; and
- $P(U)$ is a probability function defined over the domain of $U$.


## How are SCMs and DAGs related?

A recursive SCM implies a DAG, by following the order of arguments in the set of functions $F$. E.G.:

:::{layout-ncol=2}

::::{.column}
$$
F = \begin{cases}
      Z \leftarrow f(U_Z)
\end{cases}
$$

## How are SCMs and DAGs related?

- A (recursive) SCM *implies* a DAG,
- but has strictly more information as not only the functional *arguments* are known,
- but also the *functions* themselves

## Intervening in a SCM: a submodel

A recursive SCM implies a DAG, by following the order of arguments in the set of functions $F$. E.G.:

:::{layout-ncol=2}

::::{.column}
$$
F = \begin{cases}
      Z \leftarrow f(U_Z) \\
      X \leftarrow X' \\
      Y \leftarrow f(X, Z, U_Y)
\end{cases}
$$

We can compute the *effect of an action* by replacing one $f$ with a constant, e.g. $X \leftarrow X'$, keep everything else the same, and evaluate the outcomes

## Intermezzo: critique on the hierarchy

- The Pearl Causal Hierarchy is a hiearchy of **questions**
- Some (rightly) argue that the 'higher' we go, the more *prior assumptions* are needed, and the less we rely on experiments
- In a sense of *empirical* science, the hierarchy is upside down


## Theorem 1

![Theorem 1](figs/bareinboim-theorem1.png)

# Unpacking an example

## example 7a {auto-animate=true}

$X$: treatment, $Y$: outcome, $U_1, U_2$: exogenous noise variables; $p(U_1=1)=p(U_2=1)=0.5$

$$
F = \begin{cases}
      X \leftarrow U_1 \\
      Y \leftarrow U_2
\end{cases}
$$

- treatment: coin flip
- survival: coin flip (not affected by $X$)

. . .

$$
F' = \begin{cases}
      X \leftarrow 1_{U_1=U_2} \\
      Y \leftarrow U_1 + 1_{X=1,U+1=0,U_2=1}
\end{cases}
$$

- survival: affected by $X$

## example 7a {auto-animate=true}

$$
F = \begin{cases}
      X \leftarrow U_1 \\
      Y \leftarrow U_2
\end{cases}
$$

$$
F' = \begin{cases}
      X \leftarrow 1_{U_1=U_2} \\
      Y \leftarrow U_1 + 1_{X=1,U+1=0,U_2=1}
\end{cases}
$$

- both models: same level 1 (observational) distribution $p(X,Y)$
- different level 2: $Y_{X}$
- cannot tell models apart from observatoinal data alone (i.e. causal effect not *identified*)

## example 7b {auto-animate=true}

$X$: treatment, $Y$: outcome, $U_1, U_2$: exogenous noise variables; $p(U_1=1)=p(U_2=1)=0.5$

$$
F = \begin{cases}
      X \leftarrow U_1 \\
      Y \leftarrow U_2
\end{cases}
$$

. . .

$$
F' = \begin{cases}
      X \leftarrow U_1 \\
      Y \leftarrow X U_2 + (1-X)(1-U_2)
\end{cases}
$$

- 'the effect of treatment is determined by the coinflip'

. . .

- both models: same level 2 (interventional) distributions
- different level 3: $Y_{X=0}=1|X=1,Y=0)$
- cannot tell models apart from level 2 data alone

# How are these counterfactuals different from the Potential Outcome framework counterfactuals?

## Potential outcomes framwork:

Image two possible futures for a patient

## Potential outcomes vs SCMs

- why I like the term *potential outcomes*: it has a clear sense of futures
- counterfactual in the PO framework: has a clear definition and interpretation
- what I don't like: using the term *counterfactual outcomes* when the *potential outcomes* are meant, and neither has occured yet
  - e.g. *counterfactual prediction*
- in the SCM frawmwork, *counterfactuals* are closer to the word:
  - a **fact** has been observed (the real world)
  - a **counter** fact has been asked
  - this actually conditions on the observed factual data (often not the case in PO framework)
    - "given that the ICU patient got vancomycin and developed acute kidney injury, would she have developed AKI if she had not received vancomycin?"
