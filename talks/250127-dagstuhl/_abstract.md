Wouter van Amsterdam — My Priorities for AI in Health

AI systems in healthcare must ultimately support safe and effective decision making. In this talk, I argue that evaluation should extend beyond predictive performance on held-out data, to the real-world setting—treating deployment itself as an intervention. I highlight how misaligned evaluation metrics can lead to harmful self-fulfilling prophecies, especially in treatment decision support.

Next, I argue researchers should build models for "Prediction under intervention" (sometimes referred to as counterfactual prediction): estimating what would happen under different treatment options, rather than expected outcomes under historical regimes regimes. I draw on methods from causal inference and off-policy evaluation, and reflect on how emerging regulatory frameworks (EU, FDA) and available RCT data can support a more rigorous approach.
