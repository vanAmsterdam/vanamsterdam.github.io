## Updates in PROTECT methods

1. swap *conditional* hazard ratio with *marginal* hazard ratio
2. calculations for model checks

## Conditional vs marginal hazard ratio

- realization: PROTECT models a conditional hazard ratio for treatment (conditional on latent factor, ... some other variables)
- trials calculate a *marginal* hazard ratio
- these are incommensurable
- can calculate a marginal hazard ratio by simulating survival times from hypothetical trials using inferred parameters and patient data by setting treatment to 0 and 1 for every patient

## PROTECT uses a latent factor model for the unobserved confounder

:::{layout="[6,4]"}

- PROTECT models the joint likelihood of 'observables':
  - treatment $T$, survival $Y$ and proxies $W$ of fitness (performance score, fraily)
  - ... conditional on 'controls' $X$ (age, stage, histology)
- in addition to 'global parameters' $\theta$ that any regression model has (e.g. treatment to outcome regression coefficient),
PROTECT has 'local parameters' (local to every patient $i=1, ... N$): $F_i$

## PROTECT inference

- by running MCMC on the 'trainig data', we get samples from the posterior distribution over PROTECT's parameters:

. . . 

\begin{align*}
p(\theta,F|T,Y,W,X) &\propto p(Y,T,W|X,\theta,F) p(F|X, \theta) p(\theta)
\end{align*}

- in PROTECT, the joint likelihood is formulated as the product of the observation sites following the causal factorization:

. . . 

\begin{align*}
p(Y,T,W|X,\theta,F) =  p(Y|T,X,\theta,F) p(T|X,\theta,F) p(W|X,\theta,F)
\end{align*}

- during inference, the posterior for latent factor $F_i$ of patient $i$ is informed by their full observed data: $X_i, W_i, T_i, Y_i$

## PROTECT model checks

- multiple models may be considered compatible with prior knowledge (in practice: different sets of priors)
- in Utrecht, we found for some priors PROTECT copied the treatment into the latent factor, leading to a violation of (a form of) positivity, and unidentifiedness of the treatment effect
- PROTECT has data-driven model checks to assess whether the latent factor 'effectively communicates' information between all its dependents (W, T, Y)
- for this, we need distributions over $F$ using *partial* information (i.e. different 'posterior predictive modes'), e.g. 'no-$Y$':

. . . 

$$P(F_i|W_i,T_i,X_i,\theta = \theta_s)$$

- note that for every sample $\theta_s$ of the posterior distribution of *global parameters*, this distirbution is different

## Nested integratoin

$$P(F_i|W_i,T_i,X_i,\theta = \theta_s)$$

- to calculate predictive likelihoods, for example for $Y$ given $X,W,T$, we need to do nested integration:

. . . 

\begin{align*}
l(Y_i|X_i,W_i,T_i,\{\theta_s\}) &= \sum_s l(Y_i|X_i,W_i,T_i,\theta_s) \\
                                &= \sum_s \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}l(Y_i|X_i,W_i,T_i,f,\theta_s)p(f|T_i,W_i,X_i,\theta_s)df
\end{align*}

## Nested integration done right

- we need to numerically approximate the integrals
- this approximation should be unbiased and good enough to not be sensitive to e.g. the random seed for MCMC
- we *can* approximate by running separate MCMC for every sample $\theta_s$, or a subset
- because this is effectively a large set of 1D integrals, can use faster approximation

## approximation in original PROTECT

![](figs/appendix_grid.png)

- take a grid of values for $f$, for each value (and a given $\theta_s$), calculate the joint likelihood of the observables for that posterior predictive mode (e.g. $W_i,T_i$)
- calculate the weighted sum of the log-likelihood of observed $Y_i$, weighted by the joint likelihood of the $F-$conditioning observables
- **omission**: calculation did not weigh in the prior probability of $f$, so the predictive likelihoods do not correspond to the actual PROTECT model

## 'new' solution: use Gauss-Hermite Quadrature

:::{layout="[8,2]"}

- to integrate over a gaussian distribution, pick $K$ carefully chosen points $X_k$ with corresponding weights $W_k$
- implemented in PROTECT library, consequences:
  - with much fewer points ($K=32$),
  - much better approximation,
  - incorporates prior over $f$
