## Who's here?

(every person introduces themselves)

## Why are we here?

- AI is changing healthcare [@joshiAIInterventionImproving2025]]
- pre deployment, need the right evidence to know AI will improve healthcare
- post deployment, 'things will change', how do we know the AI is still performing (in terms of impact on healthcare) as expected?
- FDA and EMA (and others) are developing regulations
- not all questions resolved, maybe we can help

## Morning schedule

9-12am: focus talks, 30 minutes each

:::

12.00-12.30: Plenary Discussion

**12.30 - 13.30: Lunch**

## Afternoon schedule

- 13:30: group work; work on questions, draft manuscripts

- 16:45-17:00: wrap-up

## Goal of workshop

- have focus talks in the morning
- identify pressing questions that we can answer / work on
- afternoon: continue discussion in breakouts, potentially start drafting 

# much of AI is 'predict predict predict'

---

predict sepsis

---

predict diagnosis of structural heart disease from ECG

---

predict next token in a sequence ...

---

these models take input data, model its statistical properties (e.g. what to expect for outcome $Y$ given observation $X$)

## evaluated on predictive *performance* (e.g. accuracy, AUC, calibration)

## Medical Interventions based on (AI) prediction models

- prevention: reduce risk of heart attacks with cholesterol lowering medication, based on predicted risk of a heart attack [@hippisley-coxDevelopmentValidationNew2024]
- give chemotherapy to breast cancer patients with a high risk of recurrence [@alaaMachineLearningGuide2021]
- triage / early warning: patients at high risk of sepsis [@henryTargetedRealtimeEarly2015]
- early detection: structural heart disease from ECGs performed in primary care

## AI models tend to break under data shifts

[@finlaysonClinicianDatasetShift2021]

# deploying AI in healthcare is an intervention

![[@joshiAIInterventionImproving2025]](figs/aiasintervention-paper.png)

---

the entire purpose of an AI is to *break* (improve) a system, meaning to **cause** a data shift

see a potential issue here?

# What can go wrong when AI development and deployment are misaligned?

# Where causal inference may help

## What is causal inference?

- 'classical' prediction / statistics / AI: model **associations**; know what to expect for outcome $Y$ given observation $X$, **when we keep our hands behind our back and do not change the system**
- causal inference: answers questions **what if ...** - we changed the system (i.e. intervened by giving a certain treatment $T$) - what would be the outcome $Y$?

. . .

### How to?

- association:
  - representative (observational) data
- causal inference:
  - experimental data (randomized controlled trials)
  - approximate with observational data using assumptions (unconfoundedness, positivity, consistency) 

## Also causal inference: predicting outcomes under hypothetical interventions

- expected outcome $Y$ if we give treatment $T$ to patient with features $X$
- how is this different from 'standard' prediction?

## Hilden and Habbema on prognosis [@hildenPrognosisMedicineAnalysis1987]

"Prognosis cannot be divorced from contemplated medical action, nor from action to be taken by the patient in response to prognostication.” 

:::

## What can go wrong if predictions have unclear relationship with treatment decisions?

1. treatment-naive: simply ignore treatment in the predictions
2. include treatment but there are important confounders that are not included in the model

## Treatment-naive prediction models: predict outcomes based on features, ignoring treatments

### ... that are important to the outcomes

## Which models could benefit from this?

- cardiovascular risk prediction [@peekHariSeldonQRISK32017]



# Big hurdles in AI deployment from an intervention / policy perspective


1. prediction model outputs do not automatically align with value for intervention decision making (except when clearly defined treatment strategy (i.e. 'prediction under intervention'))
2. evaluting the effects of deploying a model **is** causal inference
3. drawing conclusing from monitoring under shifts in treatment policy is hard

## How are causal models special

1. clear alignment between prediciton accuracy and value for treatment policy:

. . . 

:::{.callout-tip icon=false}

## Pick the treatment that maximizes the expected outcome

:::

2. stable predictions under shifts in treatment policy, conditional on the model's features [@fengMonitoringMachineLearningbased2024]

## What to measure

### For 'non-causal' prediction models that don't factor in treatment decisions but predict post-treatment outcomes

|               |                      | pre-deploy | deployment study | monitoring |
|---------------|----------------------|------------|------------------|------------|
|               | **metric**           |            |                  |            |
| model         | discrimination (AUC) |            |       🔁           |     🔁       |
|               | calibration          |            |   🔻          |  🔻      |
| health system | interventions    |            |       🔁           |      🔁      |
|               | patient outcomes     |            |       🔁           |      🔁      |

## What to measure

### Prediction under intervention preserves calibration under shifts in policy conditional on the model's features

e.g. [@fengMonitoringMachineLearningbased2024]

|               |                      | pre-deploy | deployment study | monitoring |
|---------------|----------------------|------------|------------------|------------|
|               | **metric**               |            |                  |            |
| model         | discrimination (AUC) |            |       🔁           |     🔁       |
|               | calibration          |            |   🔻      ✅    |  🔻    ✅  |
| health system | interventions        |            |       🔁           |      🔁      |
|               | patient outcomes     |            |       🔁           |      🔁      |

## How do RCTs fit in?

- RCTs that randomize treatment at individual patient level:
  - typical study for evaluating the effect of a new treatment
  - from these data, can develop *prediction under intervention* models (e.g. Path statement [@kentPredictiveApproachesTreatment2020])
  - typically **too small** to build powerful model, or **did not measure** right features
- RCTs that randomize deployment of AI:
  - measure effect of *deployment* on interventions and patient outcomes
  - take time; are they ethical post-deployment?

## Takeaways

- when predicting prognosis, need well defined relation between prediction and potential treatment decisions
- in particular, *prediction under intervention* has the advantages of:
  1. clear relationship between model performance and value for decision making
  2. stable calibration under shifts in treatment policy, conditional on the model's features
- these models need unconfoundedness, so either
  - develop using RCT data
  - use observational causal inference

## Bigger picture

- want AI to improve healthcare
- we're good at predicting / modeling statistical associations
- takes a jump to get to better decision making
- models developed with causality in mind can better navigate some of these jumps
  - clear relationship between performance and value for decision making
  - stable calibration under shifts in policy (conditional on model's features)
- assessing the impact of deployment on patient outcomes **is** causal inference
