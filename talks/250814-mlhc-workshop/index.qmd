## Who's here?

(every person introduces themselves)

## Why are we here?

- AI is changing healthcare [@joshiAIInterventionImproving2025]]
- pre deployment, need the right evidence to know AI will improve healthcare
- post deployment, 'things will change', how do we know the AI is still performing (in terms of impact on healthcare) as expected?
- FDA and EMA (and others) are developing regulations
- not all questions resolved, maybe we can help
